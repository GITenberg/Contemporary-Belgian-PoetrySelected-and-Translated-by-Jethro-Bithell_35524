<span style="margin-left: 7.5em; font-weight: bold;">To Émile Verhaeren.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>Tout bouge&mdash;et l'on dirait lea horizons en marche.</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Now let the dead past fall into the deep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">With all its sleepy songs and churching chimes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">You are the Bell that gospels mightier times</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">O'er men who scale the Future's rugged steep,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Not looking back to where the weaklings creep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">But, with for battle-song your iron rimes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Marching front forwards to the visioned climes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Where hearts are steeled and furious forces sweep.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Of Jewish idols and Greek gods they sang,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">But louder than their voice hard anvils rang,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And o'er their gardens smoke trailed waving hair;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">But while the old was ruined by the new,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">You pointed to a City far more fair;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And, Master, with glad hearts we follow You.</span><br />

<h3><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p>Otto Hauser refers the Belgian renascence in art and literature to the
influence of the pre-Raphaelites. The influence of painting is at all
events certain.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> That of music is not less marked.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Baudelaire has
been continued by Rodenbach, Giraud, and Gilkin. Verlaine's method in
<i>Fêtes galantes</i> is imitated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> Giraud's <i>Héros et Pierrots</i>
(Fischbacher, Paris). The naturalistic style of Zola was independently
initiated in Belgium by Camille Lemonnier, who directly influenced
Verhaeren. But the most potent influence is that of Mallarmé, whose
symbolism has transformed contemporary poetry. It was a feature of the
symbolists to return to the free metres and the simplicity of the
folk-song; and there are echoes of popular poetry in the verse of Braun,
Elskamp, Gérardy, Kinon, van Lerberghe, and Mockel.</p>

<p>Belgium is a country of mixed nationalities. The two languages spoken
are Flemish and French. Flemish is a Low German dialect, the written
form of which is identical with Dutch. Practically all educated Flemings
speak French, which is the official language; the French Belgians, who
rarely know Flemish,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are called Walloons. Only those authors who
write in French are represented in the present volume, and they may be
classed as follows:</p>

<p>Flemings:&mdash;Elskamp (French mother), Fontainas (French admixture),
Giraud, Kinon (Walloon admixture),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> van Lerberghe, Le Roy, Maeterlinck,
Ramaekers, Verhaeren.</p>

<p>Walloons:&mdash;Bonmariage (English mother), Braun (German grandfather),
Isi-Collin, Jean Dominique, Gérardy (Prussian Walloon), Gilkin (Flemish
mother), Gille, Marlow (English grandfather), Mockel (distant German
extraction), Rency, Séverin.</p>

<p>The Belgian poets are again divided into two very hostile camps with
regard to metrical questions. The Parnassians (the term is used for want
of a better) cling to the traditional forms of French verse (what Byron
called "monotony in wire"), and to the time-honoured diction; whereas
the <i>verslibristes</i> use the free forms of verse imported into France
from Germany by Jules Laforgue, and perfected by (among others) the
American Vielé-Griffin. It must be noted, however, that there is a
tendency among the <i>verslibristes</i> to return to the classical style:
Verhaeren, who wrote in <i>vers libres</i> after his first two volumes, has,
in his last book, <i>Les Rythmes souverains,</i> approximated to the regular
alexandrine. Van Lerberghe, in a letter written in 1905, condemns the
<i>vers libre</i>; but his own work is an immortal monument of its
practicability.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The chief Parnassians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> are Giraud, Gilkin (whose
<i>Prométhée,</i> however, is in <i>vers libres</i>), Gille, and Séverin, Max
Elskamp is a <i>verslibriste</i> only in his use of assonance.</p>

<p>Belgian literature begins, for all practical purposes, with Charles de
Coster's national epic <i>Uylenspiegel</i>. De Coster died young, and was
followed by the novelist Camille Lemonnier (1844-). Then comes the
flood-tide, not in literature only, for Fernand Khnopff, Georges Minnes,
Théo van Rysselberghe (the bosom friend of Verhaeren), and Constantin
Meunier are as distinguished in painting and sculpture as, for instance,
Georges Eekhoud and Joris-Karl Huysmans are in the novel.</p>

<p>The beginnings of the modern movement, which was directed, in the first
instance, against Philistinism, may be traced back to the group of
bellicose students who were gathered together at the University of
Louvain about 1880.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Some of them, among whom were Émile Verhaeren and
Ernest van Dyk (the famous Wagner tenor) founded a magazine, <i>La Semaine
des Etudiants,</i> which was soon suppressed by the University authorities.
Other students who later became famous were Iwan Gilkin and Albert
Giraud; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> Edmond Deman, who was to become Verhaeren's publisher and a
maker of beautiful books. Another student, Max Waller, who, till his
early death in 1889, was the imp of mischief in the literary world of
Belgium, founded, in rivalry with <i>La Semaine,</i> the magazine <i>Le Type</i>,
which was also suppressed. Later on Max Waller founded, in 1882, at
Brussels, together with Georges Eekhoud and Gilkin, <i>La Jeune Belgique</i>,
a review to which all the young bloods contributed, making common cause
until they divided into <i>verslibristes</i> and Parnassians, after which the
review was carried on, under the successive editorship of Waller, Gille,
and Gilkin, as the organ of the French party ("l'art pour l'art et le
culte de la forme"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>). Other reviews which provided a battling-ground
were <i>L'Art Moderne</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to which Verhaeren contributed, and <i>La
Wallonie,</i> which Albert Mockel founded at Liège in 1884.</p>

<p>The exuberant vitality of these students, though it often led them into
extremes, laid the foundation of a literature which is in many respects
the most remarkable of contemporary Europe. Now that Tolstoy is dead,
Maeterlinck and Verhaeren stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> at the head of the literature of the
whole world; and they are, as Johannes Schlaf has maintained, the
perfect types of the "new European." It is absurd to consider them as
Frenchmen; they are as much the product of their country as Ibsen is of
Norway.</p>

<p>Modern Belgium, "between ardent France and grave Germany," the focus of
all the roads of Europe, is as rich in intellectual gifts as it is
teeming with material wealth. "The vitality of the Belgians," says
Stefan Zweig in his splendid book on Verhaeren, "is magnificent. In no
other part of Europe is life lived with such intensity, such gaiety. In
no other country as in Flanders is excess in sensuality and pleasure a
function of strength. The Flemings must be seen in their sensual life,
in the avidity they bring to it, in the conscious joy they feel in it,
in the endurance they show. It was in orgies that Jordaens found the
models of his pictures: in every kermesse, in every funeral feast you
could find them to this very day. Statistics show us that Belgium stands
at the head of Europe in its consumption of alcohol. Out of every two
houses one is an inn. Every town, every village has its brewery, and the
brewers are the richest traders in the country. Nowhere else are
festivals so animated, so noisy, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> unrestrained. Nowhere else is life
so loved, and lived with such superabundance, at such fever-heat." It is
a land that has conquered the sea, and Spain, and is still unspent,
raging with greedy appetites of body and brain. Verhaeren has vaunted it
in himself:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Je suis le fils de cette race</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Dont les cerveaux plus que les dents</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sont solides et sont ardents</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Et sont voraces.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Je suis le fils de cette race</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Tenace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Qui veut, après avoir voulu,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Encore, encore et encore plus."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>The greatest of all French poets, past and present, is Émile Verhaeren.
He was born in 1855 at Saint Amand, a village on the Scheldt to the east
of Antwerp. He has described the impressions of his childhood among the
polders in his charming book <i>Les Tendresses premières</i> (1904), the
processions of ships sailing, like a dream plumed with wind, down the
river under the stars, the dikes, "la verte immensité des plaines et des
plaines"; and in the superb symbolism of <i>Les Villages illusoires</i> he
has magnified the villagers at their trades. He was educated at the
Jesuit school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> Sainte-Barbe in Ghent, with Georges Rodenbach for a
schoolfellow. Then he studied law at Louvain, made some feint of
practising at Brussels, and, in 1883, burst upon his countrymen with his
audacious book <i>Les Flamandes</i>, the fruit of close study of Flemish
<i>genre</i>-painting and the poetry of Maupassant. An indignant critic
called him "the Raphael of filth"; but he rehabilitated himself by "<i>Les
Moines</i>" (1886), sonorous poems mirroring life in a Flemish monastery,
painting monks whose asceticism is as savage and voluptuous as the huge
joy in life illustrated in <i>Les Flamandes.</i></p>

<p>These two books glow with health. But the poet had impaired his
constitution by riotous living; and the trilogy which now followed, <i>Les
Soirs</i> (1887), <i>Les Débâcles</i> (1888), and <i>Les Flambeaux noirs</i> (1890),
form one long elegy of disease. These years, his "pathological period,"
were full of the blackest pessimism and despair. He was much in London
at this time, in isolation all the more desperate as he could not speak
English. He was fascinated by the atmosphere of the English capital, its
immensity, its desolation, its fogs, identifying his own mind with all
of it: "<i>O mon âme du soir, ce Londres noir qui traîne en toi!</i>" "Je
suis l'immensément perdu," he cries out in despair; he yearns for his
brain to give way:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> "When shall I have the atrocious joy of seeing
madness, nerve by nerve, attack my mind?" But the very keenness of his
self-observation gradually brings him healing: a mastery of the body by
the brain. This intense wrestling with disease is full of significance,
and one of the lessons which Verhaeren has to teach is that new
conditions of existence, the din and dust of great cities, the
never-resting activity of modern brains, will create a new man whose
nervous system will be able to bear the strain imposed upon it. And when
one sees Verhaeren turning from self-torture to lose himself in the
energy of the restlessly progressing world, one thinks of John Addington
Symonds growing stronger over "Leaves of Grass." His recovery and
reconciliation with life are symbolized in his poem <i>Saint George</i>, one
of the collection <i>Les Apparus dans mes Chemins</i> (1891).</p>

<p>In his first two books he had been a realist and a Parnassian. The
volumes which follow are in <i>vers libres</i>, and they are, to a certain
extent, symbolistic. <i>Les Villages illusoires</i> (1894) is all symbolism:
the ferryman is the stubborn artist with the green reed of hope between
his teeth; the fishermen symbolize the selfish society of to-day; the
ropemaker weaves the horizons of the future.</p>

<p><i>Les Campagnes hallucinées</i> (1893) describes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> desolation of the
country, deserted to glut the cities; <i>Les Villes tentaculaires</i> (1895)
is a cinematograph of the town, while the play <i>Les Aubes</i> (1898)
completes the trilogy, and prophesies the dawn of a better day after a
cleansing with blood. In these three books contemporary life is
visualized, reviled, condoned, explained, and reconciled with beauty.
Poets (except Walt Whitman, whom Verhaeren continues) have turned their
eyes away from the present to the past, and sung of rural quiet rather
than of urban roar. When Henley's poem on the motor-car appeared, there
was a cry of derision; but the only thing that was wrong with the poem
was that it was not poetry. Verhaeren, however, has smitten poetry out
of workshops, anvils, locomotives, girders, braziers, pavements,
gin-shops, brothels, the Stock Exchange&mdash;out of all that is monstrous
and ugly to those who look at material things, as Ruskin did, with the
eyes of the past. The accepted ideal of beauty is Grecian; but to
Verhaeren the beauty of a thing is not in its outward form, but in the
idea that moves it. In Greece the athlete was beautiful; but strength
to-day is in the nerves; to-day we see more beauty in a face moulded by
mind than in the thews of a discus-thrower. Smoke is beautiful in the
pictures of Whistler and Monet; the toil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> grimy workmen is sublime in
the sculpture of Constantin Meunier.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> For Verhaeren, as Stefan Zweig
says, "a thing is the more beautiful the more finality, will, power,
energy it contains. The whole universe at the present moment is
overheated; it is straining in throes of endeavour; our great towns are
nothing but centres of multiplied energy; their machines are the
expression of forces tamed and organized; their innumerable crowds are
joined together in harmonious action. Thus to Verhaeren all things
appear full of beauty. He loves our epoch because it does not disperse
effort, but condenses it, because it is not scattered, but concentrated
for action. All that has will, and an aim in view, man, machine, crowd,
town, capital; all that vibrates, works, hammers, travels; all that
bears in itself fire, impulse, electricity, and feeling&mdash;all this rings
in his verse. Everything lives its minute; in this multiple gear there
is no dust, no useless ornamentation; but everywhere is creation; the
feeling of the future directs all action. The town is a living being."</p>

<p>Verhaeren knows the great cities of Europe. He has felt the spell of
Hamburg, as well as of Hildesheim and of little towns in Spain. We have
seen him during his period of depression isolated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> in London, and while
in England he was fascinated by the reek of soot and tar in Liverpool
and Glasgow. In London he would take a ticket to anywhere on "the
underground," and roll along for hours; he wandered about the docks, and
dreamed among the mummies in the British Museum. And though the town of
his poems may be any town, it is no doubt, at the back of his mind,
London.</p>

<p>In <i>Les Heures claires</i> (1896) and <i>Les Heures d'après-midi</i> (1905),
Verhaeren sings the "douce accalmie" of his wedded life. To translate
some of the poems in these collections would be like forcing one's way
into a sanctuary. As this:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Très doucement, plus doucement encore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Berce ma tête entre tes bras,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Mon front fiévreux et mes yeux las;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Très doucement, plus doucement encore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Baise mes lèvres, et dis-moi</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ces mots plus doux à chaque aurore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Quand me les dit ta voix</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Et que tu t'es donnée, et que je t'aime encore."</span><br />
</p>

<p>In another trilogy <i>Toute la Flandre</i> (<i>Les Tendresses premières</i>, 1904;
<i>La Guirlande des Dunes</i>, 1907; <i>Les Héros</i>, 1908) he sings his native
province. Of his plays, <i>Le Cloître</i>, in the translation of Osman
Edwards, was staged, with honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> and glory to all concerned, by the
Gaiety Theatre in Manchester in 1910.</p>

<p>The reputation of Verhaeren's schoolfellow, Georges Rodenbach (1855-98),
has waned considerably since his death. He trails such weary
Alexandrines as:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Aux heures du soir morne où l'on voudrait mourir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Où l'on se sent le cur trop seul, l'âme trop lasse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Quel rafraîchissement de se voir dans la glace."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Verhaeren and Rodenbach were followed on the benches of the Collège
Sainte-Barbe at Ghent by Charles van Lerberghe, Maurice Maeterlinck, and
Grégoire Le Roy. Van Lerberghe's first work, <i>Les Flaireurs</i> (1889), is
in a style which is said to have suggested that of Maeterlinck's first
plays. His comedy <i>Pan</i> (1906) is full of devilment. In his lyric verse
there is no sediment; all is clear and rippling like a beck dancing down
a hill-side in the sunshine of summer dawn. If poetry is music, he is a
poet unparalleled. He sings</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Avec des mots</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Si frais, si virginaux,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Avec des mots si purs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Qu'ils tremblent dans l'azur,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Et semblent dits,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Pour la première fois au paradis."</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>What a gem is this poem:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Elle dort dans l'ombre des branches,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Parmi les fleurs du bel été.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Une fleur au soleil se penche....</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">N'est ce pas un cygne enchanté?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Elle dort doucement et songe.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Son sein respire lentement.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Vers son sein nu la fleur allonge</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Son long col frêle et vacillant.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Et sans qu'elle s'en effarouche,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">La longue, pâle fleur a mis,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Silencieusement, sa bouche</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Autour du bean sein endormi.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Ce que nous enseigne Charles van Lerberghe," says Albert Mockel in his
masterly book on his friend, "c'est la puissance de la grâce. Le charme
de ses vers est unique; le sentiment dont ils nous pénètrent a une sorte
de plénitude heureuse qui console le cur en appelant l'âme vers la
clarté. Une onde invisible nous rafraîchit, nous pacifie ... Mais la
force des plus grands peut seule se fléchir à une pareille douceur, et
il faut la sûreté d'un incomparable artiste pour faire de la parole
écrite cette chose lumineuse et impondérable qui semble autour de nous
comme une poussière d'or suspendue."</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to enter into details here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span> about Maeterlinck;
he needs no introduction to English readers. He has only published one
volume of lyrics, <i>Serres Chaudes</i> (1889), which is now printed with the
fifteen songs he wrote later. In a music laden with sleep rise the
faint, forced lilies of a super-sensitive soul, looking through glass
darkly at a world whose contradictions seem irreconcilable. Verhaeren
has characterized these poems as follows: "C'était d'une inattendue
angoisse, d'une extraordinaire et infinie tristesse, d'une plainte
profonde et simple sortie de l'instinct scellé au fond de nous-mêmes.
Cela ne s'expliquait pas, mais cela perforait le fond de notre âme et
trouvait sa justification dans tout l'inexplicable et dans tout
l'inconnu. L'inconscient ou plutôt la subconscience y reconnaissait son
langage, ou plutôt son balbutiement...."</p>

<p>Grégoire Le Roy has been an electrician, and is now Librarian of the
<i>Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts</i> at Brussels. He is the poet of
retrospection, as Maeterlinck is the poet of introspection. His heart
"pleure d'autrefois." He is the hermit bowed down by silver hair,
bending at eventide over the embers of the past, visited by weird guests
draped with legend. The weft of his verse is torn by translation, it
cannot be grasped, it is wafted through shadows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span></p>

<p>Max Elskamp is a poet who reminds one that Mariolatry is Minnesong.
There is no reason why the devout should not be edified by his poems,
but his intention is rather to give a subtle idealization of Flemish
life. Those who know Flemish painting will easily read themselves into
the enchanting version of Flanders that he gives us, a Flanders how
different to that of Verhaeren and yet how equally true!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Et c'est alors un pays d'ailes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Aux hirondelles,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Flandres des tours</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Et de naïf et bon séjour;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Et tout d'amour."</span><br />

<p>Thomas Braun, Victor Kinon, and Georges Ramaekers are fervent Roman
Catholics. Braun's <i>Livre des Bénédictions</i> is a beautifully printed
book illustrated by the quaint woodcuts of his brother, who is a
Benedictine monk. It is a thoroughly Flemish book; but a volume of verse
which he has just published, <i>J'ai plié le genou</i> (published by Deman),
is Walloon in feeling. His other volume, <i>Philatélie</i> (Bibliothèque de
l'Occident, Paris, 1910) is poetry for stamp-collectors! Braun and Kinon
are bucolic poets, somewhat in the manner of the French poet Francis
Jammes, who aims at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> uncompromising fidelity to nature and the utmost
simplicity of diction. But part of Kinon's work is in the style of Max
Elskamp, fascinating poetry concerning pilgrimages,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the
devotional life of Flanders. Ramaekers, the editor of <i>Le Catholique,</i>
is inspired "par la vision si riante et si forte du Brabant jovial,
intime, et monastique." <i>Le Chant des Trois Règnes</i> is a forest of
mysticism. The "Three Reigns" are those of the Father = the cult of
minerals; the Son = of plants; the Holy Ghost = of Love. Some of the
poems would delight an architect. His knowledge of paintings appears
equally well in his other volume of verse, <i>Les Saisons mystiques</i>
(Librairie moderne, Brussels, 1910).</p>

<p>André Fontainas is a symbolist of the symbolists. Mallarmé himself could
not have bettered the following exciting sonnet:</p>

<p>But the great mass of his poetry is perfectly intelligible. He is a
romanticist, but in a new sense; for whereas the old romanticists turned
from the sordid present to the motley middle ages and the choral pomp of
Rome, Fontainas haunts the labyrinths of his soul, and projects his
conscience beyond the bounds of space and time. In Fontainas, as in
Gérardy, knights ride through pathless forests, but these are not the
knights of Spenser. The <i>Faëry Queen</i> is a record of events in the outer
world; Fontainas is a <i>chevalier errant</i> in the inner world of the
spirit, and his castles are only settling-places for the dove of thought
winging out of the unknown.</p>

<p>Iwan Gilkin and Albert Giraud are Satanists. Gilkin's <i>La Nuit</i>, "une
vision terrifiante des turpitudes humaines," is the most interesting
book in Baudelaire's style since Baudelaire. He began it with the
intention of continuing his pilgrimage in two following books through
Purgatory and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span> Paradise; but, as he warns his readers in the preface to
<i>La Nuit: This is Hell!</i> Gilkin seems to have had no aptitude for
Purgatory and Paradise after Hell; at all events, his following works
have nothing to make an Englishman blush. <i>Le Cérisier Fleuri</i> (1899) is
a collection of verse in the classical style; but Gilkin has since
given his best work to the drama: <i>Prométhée</i> (1899), <i>Etudiants russes</i>
(1906), <i>Savonarole</i> (1906). <i>Jonas</i> (1900) is a satire predicting the
conquest of Europe by Asia.</p>

<p>Albert Giraud is undoubtedly a poet of high rank. His colouring is
marvellous. Above all, he is a very personal poet; one can always hear
the beating of his heart&mdash;"À maint endroit le sentiment mal contenu
crève l'enveloppe de sérénité."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He is a pessimist and a
Baudelairian: "Il se plaît," says Désiré Horrent, "à remuer le fond
vaseux des âmes, à goûter le charme morbide des voluptés rares et
raffinées."</p>

<p>Albert Mockel is one of those very rare cases in which a good critic is
at the same time a good poet. As a critic<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> he has probably no rival
except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span> Remy de Gourmont. His hall-mark is subtlety; but his learning,
too, makes one gasp. (He might, no doubt, have been a professor if he
had not been so brilliant). His poetry is philosophy; and the wonderful
thing is that it should be such poetry. It is as light as a breeze, and
like a deep river that shows its pebbles. He has in preparation a book
of verse, <i>La Flamme Immortelle</i>, which will be a magnificent
realization of his doctrine of <i>Aspiration.</i> Verhaeren interprets the
outer world, Mockel the inner world as reflected in the outer world: for
existence is double, form and shadow. Mockel has written, too, a child's
story-book, <i>Contes pour les enfants d'hier</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which should not be
given to children.</p>

<p>Paul Gérardy is a well-known German poet as well as a French one. He
belongs to the school of Stefan George.</p>

<p>In Georges Marlow's poetry the prevailing note is refinement. He has
written little, but what he has written is of the first water. Some of
the verse in his collection <i>L'Ame en Exil</i> is like Brussels lace:</p>

</p>

<p>Fernand Séverin, who is lecturer in French literature at the University
of Ghent, is a poet of great charm. His diction is apparently that of
Racine, but in substance he is essentially modern. "Virginal" is the
epithet the French critics apply to him, and it describes his chaste,
transparent poetry very well. "Tout y est en nuances, mystérieusement
fuyantes et fondues" (Victor Kinon). He dreams:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">"les mains pleines de roses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Et le cur enlacé de longs rameaux de lys."</span><br />
</p>

<p>He is full of languor:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Car mes rêves sont las comme de blancs oiseaux</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">En qui verse l'ennui de l'azur et des eaux</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Le suprême désir de dormir sur les grèves."</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Isi-Collin's <i>La Vallée heureuse</i> is full of fine things. In such a poem
as <i>La Mort d'Ophélie</i> the influence of pre-Raphaelite paintings may be
discerned. There is Wordsworthianism in his verse (especially <i>Le
Pâtre</i>), as there is in Severin's; not a voluntary absorption into the
outer world, but a passing reflection of it in the inner being; no
direct message, but a statement of a state.</p>

<p>The only poetess in our collection is Jean Dominique. Besides <i>L'Anémone
des Mers</i> she has published <i>La Gaule Blanche</i> and <i>L'Aile Mouillée</i>
(Mercure de France, 1903 and 1909). Her verse is exquisitely feminine,
shimmering like shot silk, intimately personal, and perfect in form.
"She notes the very shadow that roses cast on her soul." She has written
poems which are worthy of Sappho, as that which begins:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Dans la chaleur muette le ciel lisse ses plumes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Comme un grand épervier aux ailes floconneuses;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Mais ce soir, l'oiseau d'or entravé dans les brumes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Blotti contre la terre humble et délicieuse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Dormira sur le cur des femmes amoureuses."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Georges Rency's Pegasus was a delicate steed with iridescent blue wings
when he took it out into the shadows, and the moonlights, and the dawns,
and recorded its flights on excellent paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span> Since then it seems to
have died of inanition, but he himself has produced a robust body of
novels and criticism.</p>

<p>As to Sylvain Bonmariage, he is a prodigy. He is twenty-four years of
age, and he has written twelve books. Every one of his plays has seen
the footlights. "Précoce à épouvanter le diable et candide à ravir les
saints," is Albert Giraud's description of him.</p>

<p>Our collection does not exhaust the poetry of Belgium. Perhaps no poem
we have selected has so good a chance of immortality as a snatch of song
by Léon Montenaeken:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">La vie est vaine:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Un peu d'amour,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Un peu de haine....</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Et puis&mdash;bonjour!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">La vie est brève:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Un peu d'espoir,</span><br />

Because its secret spirit makes it light.<br />
Its perfect circle sinks into the skin,<br />

Yet keeps its agile grace and still is strong.<br />
So love, which in this symbol lies, with no<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before the light from lips of flowers fares</span><br />

Offer your lips to the evening breeze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sings among the branches and passes,</span><br />
Lay back your head on my knees,<br />

Bathed in the sunset's red,<br />
And the radiant gold of your head.)<br />

(The noise of a wing that lags<br />
Dies in the waterflags.<br />

With the afterglow,<br />
Mysterious and slow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stay on the bank and o'er the waters bend</span><br />
Their faces of silence.)<br />
<br />
Dream of our love, of our joys,<br />
And in the shadow sing them low;<br />
At the rim of your naked lips<br />
My voice shall ambush your voice.<br />
<br />
(The moonbeams slow and white<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Linger on the forest tops,</span><br />
Fall and glide on the river they light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now a veil of radiance drops</span><br />
On our protecting willow....)<br />

<br />
Thou whom the summer crosses, as a fawn,<br />
Red in the sun, through forest alleys springs,<br />
My soul with the deep shadows round thee drawn,<br />
Hast thou not seen the sad, blonde swarm of bees<br />
Pass hanging on the eddies of the breeze,<br />
Bearing on millions of exiguous wings<br />
A little motionless and gilded queen?...<br />
<br />
Hast thou not felt the orphan grace that starts<br />
To life with life in any beast, and glows,<br />
Tormented with enchantment, in the hearts<br />
Of delicate fawns and simple eyes of does?...<br />
<br />
My sylvan soul, so full of nests and warm,<br />
Remembering thy flown birds with pangs how keen,<br />
Shalt thou not ever, in parched summer's breath,<br />
Hang like a humming heart and keep the swarm<br />
Of gilded bees bearing their golden queen<br />
Upon thine orphan heart more sad than death?...<br />
<br />
And shalt thou ever of ecstatic nights,<br />
And of the royal Summer crossing earth,<br />
Know but the printed foot in amorous flights<br />
Of the red fawn, and shadow-dappled mirth?...<br />
<br />
Soul whom the Winter too shall cross ere long,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>And, after, Passion's Spring as bindweeds strong,<br />
More sad than death shall thou not ever seize<br />
This little orphan, golden queen, in state<br />
Borne round the world upon the eddying breeze<br />
By many a thousand longings that vibrate?...<br />

<br />
The slender Ursula has decked her hair,<br />
And her pale visage, and her trailing gown<br />
With odorous collars and with shining pearls;<br />
Her tapering hand the precious burden holds<br />
Of a sheaf of delicately broken folds;<br />
Her fragile temple bears the seal of God.<br />
<br />
There comes to meet her, o'er the port's green wave,<br />
A gallant pagan prince clad with gold hair,<br />
And grace and love, and loveliness suave.<br />
The maiden and the youth have mouths so grave,<br />
That in the sleeping air on the lagoon<br />
Already seem the harps of death to swoon....<br />
<br />
Ursula, virgin, humble as blonde thatch,<br />
Is earnest, and in costly raiment straight,<br />
And like a kingdom taketh her the prince....<br />
But she already knows love there is none!<br />
<br />
But she already knows another youth,<br />
The fairest archer of a lordly race,<br />
Awaits her at another ocean's rim<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>To free her sovran soul to fly to God....<br />
<br />
And yet she cometh, with her exquisite neck<br />
Beaten by tresses garlanded with pearls,<br />
And the golden youth who loves her with sad cheer<br />
Hearkens approaching nigh his trembling heart,<br />
Following her silent step, a host of wings!...<br />

If you can see my soul within my eyes,<br />
I will be softer than a bed of down<br />
For your fatigue to sigh in and to swoon;<br />
I will be kinder to you and more sweet<br />
Than after vain adieux returning soon,<br />
And tenderer than a sky bedimmed with doves!<br />
<br />
Ah! if you feel my heart rise in my eyes,<br />
Like the sick perfume of the autumn rose,<br />
If you will enter on my spirit's waste,<br />
Upon whose stones no foot but yours shall sound,<br />
If you will love my visions and my vows,<br />
I will be more your kin than all your own!<br />
<br />
Upon my soul's wild thyme and moss, and on<br />
Its bare stones where the sun is wont to dance,<br />
And in its wind with fire and solace laden,<br />
In the whole desert of my crimson love,<br />
I will immerse you in my honeycombs.<br />
<br />
Ah! can you gaze into my blinding soul,<br />
And know my heart has leapt into my eyes,<br />
As the sling sends after the singing bird<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>A stone at the mysterious welkin thrown?...<br />
<br />
If you will scan the desert of mine eyes,<br />
O you will see what suffering immense,<br />

I will put my two hands on mine eyes, lest you<br />
Should in them find what I were fain you knew.<br />
<br />
I will put them on my bosom, to conceal<br />
That which might seem the desperate heart's appeal.<br />
<br />
And I will put them gently into yours,<br />
My two hands sick with grief that long endures....<br />
<br />
And they shall come full of their tenderness,<br />
Most silently, and even with no caress,<br />
<br />
With the whole burden of a secret broken,<br />
Of which my mouth, eyes, heart had gladly spoken.<br />
<br />
Tired of being empty they to you shall come,<br />
Heavy with sadness, sad with being dumb;<br />
<br />
So desolate, discouraged, pale and frail,<br />
That you may bend, perhaps, and see they ail! ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><br />

<br />
All at the heart of a far domain,<br />
With those to whom our hearts do strain,<br />
My Truelove weeps for me, distraught<br />
By my death the week has wrought.<br />
My heart's Belovèd grieveth sore,<br />
And plunges her two hands like flowers<br />
Into her eyes whose sorrow showers,<br />
My heart's Belovèd grieveth sore.<br />
<br />
All at the heart of a far domain,<br />
Unto her feet her skates she ties,<br />
Feeling that in her heart is ice,<br />
Far unto me her tired feet strain;<br />
My Truelove hangs to the Chapel pane,<br />
That gazes over all the plain,<br />
With rings, and salt, and dry bread, my<br />
Wretched soul that will not die.<br />
<br />
All at the heart of a far domain,<br />
My Truelove never will weep again<br />
The festivals the seasons bring,<br />
With family rings on fingers twain;<br />
My Love has seen me promising,<br />
Like a saint, to spirits pure<br />
A Sunday that shall aye endure,<br />
And all at the heart of a far domain.<br />

Unto the islands of the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where went my merchandize of old,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By winds on other oceans rolled</span><br />
From isle to island of the sea.<br />
<br />
But I have donned the broken shoes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of those who dwell on land, and sprent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My tongue with ash of discontent</span><br />
Because my memory seems to lose<br />
<br />
The sounding Psalm that sang You Hail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who decked my prows in gold attire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in Your hands the sheets were fire,</span><br />
The sun a spreading peacock's tail.<br />
<br />
Now be it so, since in me stays<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Salvation that the sails possess</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under the wind the stars caress</span><br />
Of far beyond and other days,<br />
<br />
And let it be Your self-same Grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this to-day of broken shoon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The same sky, and the same round moon</span><br />

It is a voyage round about,<br />

Sailing the seas as years go by,<br />

Happy as any child at play,<br />
While from spires and steeples they<br />

Proclaim the simple Gospel peace<br />
With their showering melodies<br />

From the gold dawn to the sunset sky,<br />
Greeted, Mary of Houses, by<br />

The brown, centennial earth they till.<br />

And sing now, all ye merry men<br />
Who plough the glebe, sing once again<br />
<br />
Your Flanders sweet to larks that sing<br />
With gladsome voices concerting,<br />

And sail afar, ye ships that glass<br />

<br />
<br />
O voice vibrating like the song of birds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O frail, sonorous voice wherein upwells</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laughter more bright than ring of wedding bells,</span><br />
I listen to her voice more than her words.<br />
<br />
Soul of old rebecs, spirit of harpsichords,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within her voice your soft inflection dwells;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blisses of love some ancient viol tells,</span><br />
Kiss snatched by lips that swift lips turn towards.<br />
<br />
Her voice is sweetness of chaste dreams, the scent<br />
Of iris, cinnamon, and incense blent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A music drunk, a folded mountain's calm;</span><br />
<br />
It is within me made of living sun,<br />
Of luminous pride and rhythms vermilion;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is the purest, the most dazzling psalm.</span><br />

Autumnal ocean rolling under him.<br />
<br />
His listless dream goes wandering without goal;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is not one who would be passion's slave;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no remorse, nor memory from its grave</span><br />
May haunt the leisure of his empty soul.<br />
<br />
He does not hear the melancholy chaunt<br />
Of girls who beg before him, hollow, gaunt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fasting, coughing in the mellow sun,</span><br />
<br />
And unawares, he knows not how it came,<br />
he feels within his hardened heart a flame,<br />

The Princess of the Manor's Games and Joys.<br />

Lifts in a dawn of amethysts<br />
Her tender visage that more sadly aches<br />
Than gloamings on the lunar face of lakes,<br />
With lingering smile upon her lip she lists,<br />
And casts a call into the evening mists.<br />

In spite of omens tragical,<br />

To lawns where sistrum, fife, and drum<br />

<br />
O King! like mourning is our merry-making!<br />
Out of our arms thou hast thyself exiled,<br />
And by our kisses art no more beguiled!<br />
Our hearts for thee are aching!<br />
Thou hast fled, thou hast fled,<br />
And in the night I raise my head,<br />
And call for thee with sobs, and bosom sore!<br />
But still our festivals shall be forsaken,<br />
The mourning from our hearts shall not be taken,<br />
My fingers nevermore<br />
Shall o'er thy golden velvet tresses glide;<br />
My heavy arms shall nevermore thy neck enlace<br />
In passionate embrace<br />
Rich with the jewels of the bracelets of my pride!<br />
<br />
Farandola and roundelay,<br />
And the mad songs of pride,<br />
In sudden waves over the threshold glide,<br />
And through the chambers sway.<br />
<br />
Thou never shalt return from unknown lands,<br />
O King! The sceptre is fallen from thy hands,<br />
The lassitude that lulled thee in its lap<br />
Has stolen from thy proud, young years their sap,<br />
Now art thou crossing thresholds far forlorn<br />
Of mysteries and adventures luring thee<br />
Where monsters crouch beneath the twisted tree;<br />
Chimeras and the pitiless unicorn<br />
Shall belch their fire where thou thy way wouldst grope<br />
And thou shalt nevermore have my caress<br />
To soothe thee into happy heedlessness<br />
Of life, and perils of inimical hope.<br />

O come back, ere it be too late!<br />

Of them that love thee, and the memory<br />
Of thine ancestors shall bring back to thee<br />
Forgetfulness of mad adventures in the kiss<br />

How vain are songs! Can they be worth the hymn<br />
To your ecstatic eyes of mine that swim?<br />
The noblest song of man no bosom stirs,<br />
Weak are sonorous words, but conquerors<br />
Are ye, glances of amber and of fire,<br />
Lips you, and clinging kisses slow to tire<br />
That in my soul are scorching! You that dare<br />
Leap out of longing, kisses! And you hair<br />
Of virgin gold that glints like noonday suns!<br />
And marble whiteness where, like lava, runs<br />
Your wild blood, snow and brazier!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Here I lie</span><br />
Your slave for ever, at your feet I die<br />
In sleepful spasms that the senses cloy,<br />
And the slow languor of the tasted joy;<br />
Mad with your velvety and waxen flesh<br />
That holds my soul and body in its mesh;<br />
I love you, I am poured out at your feet,<br />
Your hands are with lascivious jasmine sweet,<br />
Your beauty blooms for me! In my embrace<br />
I feel your life blowing upon my face,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>And entering into me! Your blinding eyes<br />
Thrill me with raptures of that Paradise<br />
Whose rubies bleed, whose yellow topazes<br />
Sleep in the sloth of sensualities,<br />
And where the limitless horizons hide<br />
Our Hell of luxuries grated round with pride.<br />
I love thee, though the kisses of thy teeth,<br />
Cunning to bite in their red vulva sheath,<br />
Have the allure of Lamias that enslave<br />
With luxury swift and cruelty suave.<br />
Through tortures from your native Orient swim<br />
Ineffably pure o'er peaceful lakes the slim<br />
Swans of your voice white in their wildering<br />
And subtle scents of snow, and on their wing<br />
Bear me towards the hope your bright eyes beam.<br />
Now let me lie upon your breasts and dream.<br />
Say nothing! Let us sleep in our blue bower<br />
Under the tufted pleasures of the hour,<br />
By the night's tranquil torpor lulled and kissed ...<br />
Already yon far dawn of amethyst<br />
Dyes the deep heavens, and the moon at rest<br />
Upon her soft cloud cushions hath caressed<br />
With argent light the forest's idle trance,<br />
And starred the stream with eyes that gleam and glance!<br />
<br />
And now the dawn is on our pillow&mdash;hide<br />
Your eyes&mdash;I shiver&mdash;they are haggard, wide!<br />

Its gleams reflected in the rest of waves.<br />

Now here you stand in gardens flowered with alga, cold<br />

The sun's clear song makes the horizon ring.<br />

The scent of sage and thyme is as a sting<br />

The tiring hour that weeps,<br />
And the young hour gay with sun,<br />
Hour after hour creeps,<br />
Hours after hours run<br />
Along the river banks.<br />
<br />
This is an hour of dawn that vapour cloaks.<br />
Yonder a thread, so it would seem,<br />
Stretches a bridge across the stream.<br />
Shadow follows shadow, the mist chokes<br />
The water sleepy as a moat's,<br />
A tug smokes,<br />
And drags its heavy, grating chain,<br />
And drags its train<br />
Of ghostlike boats,<br />
Walls of black<br />
Along a hidden track<br />
Towards the arches blear<br />
Where now they disappear.<br />
<br />
Like sudden palms of gold,<br />
Three sunbeams glide<br />
To where the waters hide,<br />
And all along the river in the cold<br />
Life is again begun,<br />
With all its joys<br />
Of toil and noise<br />
Awakening in the quivering, crimson sun.<br />
<br />
The hour is rising radiant with mirth,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Beaming smiles down on the earth,<br />
O festival of light!<br />
Here is life that smiles upon its toil,<br />
And with high forehead makes the night recoil<br />
Towards the sun in heavens bright<br />
With strength and with delight.<br />
<br />
Life quickens on faces<br />
Mad and fervent zest.<br />
To live! is when the hot blood races<br />
And swells the breast,<br />
And makes the words leap out in ready throng!<br />
Life is to be alone and strong,<br />
And master of one's fate!<br />
Ye floods of purple pour in state,<br />
Ripen the morn, and roll men's blood along!<br />
<br />
The wise<br />
Have never lived and do not know what joys<br />
Are in mad battle, carnage and great noise,<br />
When courage with courage vies.<br />
The wise<br />
Are they who when the cautious eve creeps on to night<br />
Exile themselves from the festival of light<br />
Weeping its tears of proud gold on the river,<br />
O'er the lamp-lit book to shiver.<br />
To live<br />
Is better, and to ring one's heel<br />
On the floor of a palace won by crimsoned steel,<br />
Or underneath a charger's hoofs to tread<br />
The grass of roads down-trodden by the fugitive<br />
Foe who has dyed them red.<br />
<br />
But the young hour gay with sun,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>The tiring hour that weeps,<br />
Hour after hour creeps<br />
Hours after hours run<br />

<br />
Now cooler are noon's beams,<br />
O dreams reposed with languor and with ease,<br />
The waters creep,<br />
O calm dreams!<br />
Upon the moss in shade of elms and alder-trees<br />
The peaceful fishers sleep;<br />
A long thread swims upon the dying stream.<br />
In the foliage never a shiver,<br />
The sun darts never a beam,<br />
All is dumb.<br />
The earth around, the meadows and the river,<br />
And the air with sunshine numb,<br />
And the forest with its leafy houses,<br />
Everywhere all action drowses,<br />
And the earth hesitates with indecision,<br />
A smoker's vague vision.<br />
<br />
The only wisdom is to live<br />
The hours of the river, sleeping on its slopes.<br />
Why should we madly follow fugitive<br />
Inclement pride and crumbling hopes<br />
Along the precipices of the heavy night,<br />
That swallows up all ruined light?<br />
No! to live<br />
Is to follow all the river's turnings,<br />
Sailing one's life with dreams and yearnings,<br />
With prow set to the Orient of oblivion,<br />
To conquer all the sea and all the isles that smile,<br />
That no discoverer will ever set foot on<br />
Save he who kept desire a virgin, all the while,<br />

She will be ever humming them, disguising<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">My soul with the golden gamut of her own.</span><br />

How sateless her soul is and wild.<br />
<br />
The lustful virgin, the child<br />

And then, afar, a screeching of dark fright,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like cries of a frail conscience that has sinned.</span><br />

With blear eyes through drear darkness, and who blights<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The peace of sleep with stark foreboding fears.</span><br />
<br />
The inconsolable night-bird weeping through<br />

Whose panic flitting chills the dark, and who<br />

But thou, poor owl, an ivied steeple seëst,<br />

I am angry with you, little girl,<br />

And your restful lips, and teeth of pearl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the black glitter of your great eyes.</span><br />
<br />
I am angry with you, but on my knees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For when I went away, in happy wise,</span><br />
Far from you, far as goes the breeze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I could think of nothing but of your eyes.</span><br />
<br />
I was timid, I never dared look back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I went singing as madmen do,</span><br />
To forget your eyes, alack!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But my song was all about you.</span><br />

The song of moonlight all<br />

The thrush sang it at the evenfall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the listening swan on the blue lake.</span><br />
<br />
It is all of love and distress,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of joy and of love, and then</span><br />
There are sobs of gold and weariness,<br />

Far, far away flew the thrush,<br />

<br />
A surgeon, I the souls of men dissect,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bending my feverish brow above their shameless</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perversions, sins, and vices, all their nameless</span><br />
Primitive lusts and appetites unchecked.<br />
<br />
Upon my marble men and women spread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their open bellies, where I find the hidden</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ulcers of passions filthy and forbidden,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>And probe the secret wounds of dramas dread.<br />
<br />
Then, while my arms with scrofulous blood are dyed,<br />
I note in poems clear with scrupulous art<br />
What my keen eyes in these dark deeps descried.<br />
<br />
And if I need a subject, I am able<br />
To stretch myself on the dissecting table,<br />
And drive the scalpel into my own heart.<br />

<a name="THE_CAPITAL" id="THE_CAPITAL"></a>THE CAPITAL.<br />
<br />
<br />
A dolorous fruit is the vast capital.<br />
Its bursten skin and pulp too ripened dye<br />
Opulently their rich rottenness<br />
With green gold, violet, and red phosphorus.<br />
<br />
Oozing a sickly sweet, thick, cancerous juice,<br />
Its spongy flesh melts in the mouth, and in<br />
Its pensive poisons germinate the rank,<br />
Perverted sins of fever-tortured brains.<br />
<br />
So strange its spice, so exquisite its taste,&mdash;<br />
A macerated ginger in a rare elixir,&mdash;<br />
I plunged my teeth in it with greedy haste.<br />
<br />
But dizziness I ate, and madness drank.<br />
And that is why I trail a debile frame,<br />
With my youth dying in the husk of my strength.<br />

And in new Sodoms viciously aglow,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>Where outrage hides its lusts with murder nigh,<br />
<br />
I watch in flaring nights with mournful eye,<br />
And shuddering hear what monsters still we grow.<br />
And all the crimes of men oppress me so<br />
I call for vengeance to the angered sky.<br />
<br />
Wrathful as prophets went in Holy Writ,<br />
I walk with haggard cheek in public places,<br />
Confessing sins that I do not commit.<br />
<br />
And the Pharisees cry out with upturned faces:<br />
"I thank thee, God, that I am not as this<br />

Sick Artist, from the world around thee shrinking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To nurse the high ideal of thine Art,</span><br />
Give thou no place to Nature in thy thinking,<br />
That foolish, fertile slut obscene and stinking&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the Artificial consecrate thy heart.</span><br />
<br />
In spite of reed-pipes and loud songs of marriage,<br />

The blood and flesh of women proud of carriage,<br />
The flabby flesh of women thou disparage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deny their beauty which is only dirt.</span><br />
<br />
Are thy tired spirit and thy parched mouth aching<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the cooling, carnal draught of their caress?</span><br />
This is a thirst that thou canst best be slaking,<br />
Swooning among thy lamp-lit bottles, breaking<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The odorous seals of drunken dizziness.</span><br />
<br />
Dream drunk with rum, whose tropic-heated spices<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ferment into a scented wine that joins</span><br />
Thy subtle spirit in voluptuous vices<br />
With negro women whose smooth flesh entices<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy lubric hand to their anointed loins.</span><br />
<br />
Drink kirsch, as turbulent as cascades shaded<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By forests where the maidens bathe their feet;</span><br />
Musked maraschino, sucked by mouths pomaded<br />
In the sick air of brothels golden-braided<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By those who queen it on the yielding seat;</span><br />
<br />
And, hypocrite with ice one cannot sunder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of his flame, drink kümmel, whose bright feast</span><br />
Of boreal snow-masked fire evokes the wonder<br />
Of roses under snow, O roses ... under<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Archangel heavens women of the East.</span><br />
<br />
And, for its green of bindweed-tangled fancies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drink absinthe, which shall open out to thee</span><br />
Those forests where the fairy Vivien dances,<br />
And the sage Merlin with her feet entrances<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the hoarse brushwood by the bitter sea.</span><br />
<br />
Then to thy reeling brain shall dreams come sailing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the calm bed where thy body sank,</span><br />
And thou shalt see dissolved in shadows paling,<br />
All earthly things around thee, failing, failing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While brighter surge the visions rank on rank.</span><br />
<br />
Behold! Among the wan blue vapours, steaming<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before the scented, sounding sunrise, glows</span><br />
A belt of glaciers whose thin peaks of dreaming<br />
Mirrored upon an azure lake are gleaming<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the tropic valley guarded by their snows.</span><br />
<br />
The leaves of mangoes, palms, and fig-trees sighing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are wafting coolness o'er the billowing grass,</span><br />
Where, garlanded like flowers, are women lying,<br />
Bathing their lily limbs, beneath the flying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jewels of furtive humming-birds that pass.</span><br />
<br />
And a cascade of dazzling nakednesses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Falls from the peaks of glaciers in shoals,</span><br />
And every following body holds and presses<br />
The one that went before, holds and caresses;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A living stream of beauty rolls and rolls.</span><br />
<br />
Arms, loins, and thighs are linked and intertwining,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lightnings are playing on a vaporous mesh</span><br />
Of luminous hair and supple limbs combining,<br />
And from the lofty peaks of glaciers shining<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For ever falling are new waves of flesh.</span><br />
<br />
Drink every drop of this pure wine, and waste<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In thine embraces all these limbs unreal.</span><br />
Lie in thy bed of snow, and, undebased,<br />
Enjoy all flesh in thine own flesh, and taste<br />

On broken furniture and carpets where<br />

But what thought, like a hideous diadem<br />
Of thorns, hath rent thy forehead, when the third,<br />
His white flesh scarcely sated, having heard<br />

Looked, as a bitch looks beaten with a stick,<br />

When blind, mad man, intent on gain and plunder,<br />

Throw in the coal, and pour the crackling casting<br />

The mind has ravaged space, and we are ill<br />

But thou alone, O torch of sacred Art,<br />
With first, primeval beauty warm the heart,<br />
And flash thy multiple glimpses of the Ideal;<br />

And thou, O Poet, make lost Eden shine<br />
Within us, and behind the seeming real<br />
Show us the essences of things divine.<br />

The people have had masters whose strong faces,<br />

The word they cast down from the market-places<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With bitter love and majesty unbowed,</span><br />
Threatening to make of cities desert spaces.<br />

The crowd remember yet their magic names,<br />
And echo them with thunderous acclaims<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of welcome to the coming victory.</span><br />

You are like tragic sunsets, worn were ye<br />
By legendary heroes, who enriched<br />
The Kings they served, and all the world bewitched,<br />
And who upon a copper, kindled sea,<br />

<br />
It is as warm as when the lilacs' scent<br />
Is with the fragrance of magnolias blent,<br />
When you can hear the seeds crack in the ground,<br />
When first your face and hands are summer-browned<br />
When every now and then in heavy drops<br />
The rain begins, and all as sudden stops....<br />
Slate and rust clouds voluptuously mass<br />
Their bulk o'er the green corn and nibbled grass<br />
Of fields that billow to yon purpled woods,<br />
Which, through bronzed clouds, a sheaf of sunbeam floods.<br />
<br />
Sweating, I climb the slope, where, like a long<br />
White ribbon, runs the brook and sings his song.<br />
A noisy cock pursues a clucking hen.<br />
A sparrow flies with bits of hay. And then<br />
Such is the silence you can hear from far,<br />
Where the red roof-tiles of the village are,<br />
The heavy, steady humming of the bees ...<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>(Can there be blossoms on the willow-trees?)<br />
Here is the wood.&mdash;Pale with surprise you see<br />
The ardent silence and the mystery<br />
Whose sap swells in the branches which it studs<br />
With downy catkins and with sticky buds.<br />
<br />
Under the elm-trees' violaceous shade<br />
The fresh anemones have snowed the glade;<br />
The undergrowth bathes in a fawn half-light;<br />
The pure air crackles with a lizard's flight;<br />
And there, where on the hazel bough is poured<br />
A ray of sunshine darted like a sword,<br />
A trembling cloud of yellow pollen rises....<br />
<br />
And now mysterious mirth my heart surprises<br />
With words and cries of love and tenderness,<br />
And an intoxicated glow and stress,<br />
Because the spring with legendary dyes,<br />
The white of snow and blue of Paradise,<br />
And tender green of leaves all dewy sprent,<br />
With nightingales, and honeysuckle's scent,<br />
And chafers hanging heavily from blue<br />
Lilacs, wet with rosy diamonds too,<br />
With the clear crystal and mad pearls that gush<br />
Out of the beak of quail and pairing thrush,<br />
All the divine, forgotten spring reminds<br />
My heart of ardours where the pathway winds!...<br />
I love! My breast is full of flowers and birds!<br />
I shall break out in ecstasy of words!<br />
I love!&mdash;But whom?&mdash;I care not whom nor how!<br />
I love, with all my blood in frenzy now,<br />
And all the sighs that heave my breast, the maid<br />
<br />
Who smiling comes beneath her cool sunshade....<br />

The earth is black with trees of velvet under<br />
A low sky laden with great clouds of thunder.<br />
The gnomes of midnight haunt the dark, whose ears,<br />
With luxury veiled, hear as a deaf man hears.<br />
One is uneasy in one's stifling sheets,<br />
And so uneasily the poor heart beats<br />
That, bathed in sweat, at last you leave your bed,<br />
And as in dream about the chamber tread.<br />
You throw the window open. Not a sound.<br />
Surely the wind is swooning on the ground,<br />
And listening to some holy, mystic birth<br />
Preparing in the entrails of the earth.<br />
You listen, earnest, to your heart's loud shock<br />
Beating with pained pulsations like a clock.<br />
Then to the window-sill you pull a chair,<br />
And watch the clouds weigh down the helpless air<br />
Over the gardens whence, in sick perfumes,<br />
Exudes the sweat of trees and wildered blooms.<br />

By joining hearts, lips, brows in rapt caress<br />
Far from the world, its noises and conceit ...<br />
Shall we not hide our modest love between<br />
Trees wafting cool on flowers and grasses green?<br />

I closed my window, lit my lamp, reclined<br />
My temple on my hand, and sadly thought:<br />
"Now let me read, and dream, and rest my mind ...<br />
But, O my God, my heart is so distraught!<br />
Yet, let me read." It was a traveller's book.<br />
<br />
O sailing on broad rivers, on whose shore<br />
Are baobabs and mangroves, while the song<br />
Of curious birds wafts with the ship along,<br />
Together with the tiger's grating roar....<br />
<br />
A sudden gust of wind the window shook,<br />
Followed afar off by continued whining.<br />
<br />
I throw the window open wide, to look<br />
Into the night, and see, with white teeth shining<br />
In mocking grin, Death pass upon a steed<br />
With yellow teeth, making its wet flanks bleed<br />
With spurs of bone, and in the wind its mane<br />
Tossing, together with his winding-sheet;<br />
See Death, while all the trees moan out in pain,<br />
Race under clouds lit by a livid sheet,<br />
And brandishing above him his bright scythe!<br />
<br />
Afar, Italian poplars curve their slim<br />
And parallel trunks beneath the wind of him;<br />
Dishevelled willows in the shadow writhe,<br />
And the earth, looking at the monster, pants....<br />
<br />
Now he is swallowed by the raucous squall.<br />

"Come with me, I will show thee many a lake,<br />
Valleys delightful, secret forest bowers,<br />
Where still, in other dreams than ours,<br />
The subtle spirits wake<br />
Of the earth."<br />
<br />
She stretched her arms, with laughter<br />
Looking between her lashes on<br />
The angel flaming in the sun,<br />
And, when he moved, in silence followed after.<br />
<br />
And while they wandered to the groves of shade<br />
The Angel round her laid<br />
His arm, and set<br />
Among her bright hair longer than his wings<br />
The flowers he gathered dewy wet<br />
Upon the branches over her.<br />

But the dawn in the sea<br />
Awakes and takes<br />
His torch, then he<br />
Climbs gleam by gleam,<br />
Climbs in a dream.<br />
Out of the waves arise<br />
His tresses fair,<br />
And blue eyes.<br />
<br />
At once, as they were blown<br />
Away, the shadows flee.<br />
Where? Who can see?<br />
Into the earth? Into the sea?<br />

Upon the sun at a white wheel<br />

And with blue eyes of bridal bliss<br />

<br />
<br />
The old woman spins, and her wheel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is prattling of old, old things;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As though to a doll she sings,</span><br />
And memories over her steal.<br />
<br />
The hemp is yellow and long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old woman spins the thread,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bending her white, weary head</span><br />
Over the wheel's lying song.<br />
<br />
The wheel goes round with a whirl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The yellow hemp is unwound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She turns it round and round,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>She is playing like a girl.<br />
<br />
The yellow hemp is unwound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She sees herself a girl,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As blonde as the skeins that whirl,</span><br />
She is dancing round and round.<br />
<br />
The wheel rolls round with a whirr,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the hemp is humming as well,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She hears an old lover tell</span><br />
And whisper his love for her.<br />
<br />
Her tired hands rest above<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wheel, its spinning is done,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with the hemp are spun</span><br />
Her memories of love.<br />

Little old women, my thoughts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The snow falls from the vast,</span><br />
Death and uncertainty palls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the things of the past.</span><br />
<br />
Why is my heart so chill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under these skies overcast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In these winters that last and last,</span><br />
These winters calm and still?<br />
<br />
You little old women who glean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make a bonfire of your past,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of your reeds snapped by the blast,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>And of all your barren dreams.<br />
<br />
All that your sorrow remembers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burn it like dry brushwood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sit and warm your blood</span><br />
Over the dying embers.<br />
<br />
And mumble in grief and dejection<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the happy days of your youth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And empty with fingers of ruth</span><br />
The spindles of blue recollection.<br />
<br />
And when the cottage is damp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the weeping of the night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One of you will light,</span><br />
Like a shaded, smoky lamp,<br />
<br />
&mdash;Oh! why must I weep and perish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nothing, nothing forget?&mdash;</span><br />

<br />
Glued like the eyes of a thief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At my heart's window-pane, gazing in,</span><br />
Were two pale hands, hands of grief,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hands as of Death, bone and skin.</span><br />
<br />
I shivered to see them stare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weird as the moon in the blue,</span><br />
Lifting to me their despair,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the hands of the damned might do.</span><br />
<br />
And He of those desolate hands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who was my visitor grim?</span><br />
Death on my threshold stands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since I gazed on the hands of Him.</span><br />
<br />
It was not a blessing they shed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Curst of a truth were they,</span><br />
For I have longed to be dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since I saw their ghastly ray.</span><br />
<br />
For the wine of my loving is sour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And full of tears and of harm,</span><br />
And deadens the bread of the hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That is signed with their fatal charm.</span><br />
<br />
Hands of poison! Hands of despair!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gestures of virgins of gloom!</span><br />
You have shone on my house as a pair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of candles a corpse illume!</span><br />
<br />
I have seen Hope close her door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my mourning is watching Death,</span><br />
While the North wind is blowing o'er<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My candle dead in His breath.</span><br />

<a name="MY_EYES" id="MY_EYES"></a>MY EYES.<br />

<br />
Poor eyes, you lamps that are failing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How little remains of your glow?</span><br />
Encroaching night is veiling<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The things of the here-below.</span><br />
<br />
Or is your gathering gloaming<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Indifference alone?</span><br />
O eyes that once went roaming<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Beauty and the Unknown!</span><br />
<br />
You sink your lids like a curtain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Love goes by, a flame;</span><br />
You know your sorrow is certain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And age to you is shame.</span><br />
<br />
And yet, my heart's best praising,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O flameless lamps, is for you;</span><br />
Through you my spirit gazing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">First saw, and felt, and knew!</span><br />
<br />
You showed me the mountain steep, with<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sea and the stars above,</span><br />

My rhythms of speech you aided,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by my brain you were stirred;</span><br />
<br />
Poor wrinkled hands, like two<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old women worn and wizened,</span><br />
My thoughts run on, but you<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In listlessness are prisoned.</span><br />
<br />
Yet I bless you, my hands, now that strife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is done, and the heart reposes;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You taught me the touch of roses;</span><br />
And the caresses of life.<br />
<br />
All the hands you touched, hands of brothers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of women I loved in dole,</span><br />

<br />
<br />
There is an age, sad age, and hour obscure,<br />
When man, aweary of adventurous dreams,<br />
Turns from the far horizon's lure<br />
His eyes towards the Inn of Good Repose.<br />
Then simple Thoughts and staid,<br />
Like an eager, humble serving-maid,<br />
With delicate cares discreet<br />
Lull infinite regrets to sleep,<br />
And kindle in the heart once more<br />
The fire of memories of the yore,<br />
And from the hearth drive hopes importunate,<br />
That one by one may steal within the great<br />
Silences.<br />
<br />
The silence of our memories<br />
Whereon already falls the snow of years;<br />
Love's silence, whose abandoned tomb<br />
No tender hand makes bloom;<br />
Silence of hopes long seeking, which<br />
Have died like beggars in the ditch;<br />
Silence of faith, whose torch has been put out<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>By life and doubt.<br />
<br />
These silences our brothers, in they glide,<br />
Like white monks, rigid, stern,<br />
And sit down, without speaking, at our side....<br />
Then we with Truth sojourn.<br />
Ere they had come we saw but of the world<br />
Its flowers and orchards pasturing our eyes,<br />
But, when they entered in, our deeper souls<br />
Explored, together with our thought, the night.<br />
One of life's secrets each of them reveals,<br />
One of fate's shadows each of them dispels,<br />
And they can tell us whether we have walked<br />
Along the road where God's hand pointed us.<br />
Our friends, our children, all whose life seemed bound<br />
Together with our own most intricately,<br />
We see them far, alone in the great fight<br />
Waged with Infinity, and Pain, and Death.<br />
We thought that their hands which our hands have clasped,<br />
And the long gazing of our eyes in theirs,<br />
And that our voices uttering one thought,<br />
And all our common hopes and self-same griefs,<br />
And all our evenings lived beneath one lamp,<br />
And all those hours upon one dial told,<br />
The self-same clock of destiny&mdash;<br />
Sealed our converging fates for evermore!<br />
Now suddenly we are alone, so far<br />
From life that we can scan the vast expanse<br />
That separates us and divides us all.<br />
These pure child's eyes, these beautiful fondled hands,<br />
These voices intertwined like woven flowers,<br />
Have touched perhaps, and recognized each other,<br />
But like to friends, or strangers almost, who<br />
To-morrow will resume their separate way.<br />
And now that silence from us far removes<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>The lies of love for which our senses longed,<br />
Lo, in the universe our soul is lost!<br />
The child of our own blood, who, piously,<br />
Some last, last night will come to close our eyes,<br />
How he is one, his fate how otherwise<br />
Than ours, how far removed, and how alone!<br />
He enters life! He is no more our own!<br />
<br />
Thus shall they go towards the call,<br />
Till, lonely and despoiled of all,<br />
Naked and poor we face the eternal hour!<br />
And, seeing our heart as a temple with no god,<br />
And closed our soul to every new delight,<br />
Empty our hands, and in our eyes no sight,<br />
We shall make question of ourselves: What tie<br />
Unites this lowest, lamentable thing<br />
We are ... to Immortality?<br />

They were bringing medicines one afternoon in June,<br />

<h3>ALBERT MOCKEL.</h3>

<h4>1866&mdash;.</h4>



<p class="caption"><a name="THE_GIRL" id="THE_GIRL"></a>THE GIRL.</p>


<p>Slender, and so virginal, but why not somewhat languid?&mdash;her casque of
golden hair is starred sometimes with mellow sparks, and mellow is her
mauve silk dress soft in its folds.</p>

<p>She is all music, in the music of her movements bathed, they also soft
with pensive grace, and very slow with suppleness that undulatingly
unrolls.</p>

<p>An evening party. She has danced, she dances still. Men dark and fair
have come and led her off, under the chandeliers in this insipid
music,&mdash;insipid, and amusing her. Much has she danced (O all this
light!) and feels a little weary, weary. Yes, several waltzes; of her
partners one could talk, or nearly could;&mdash;but he is ugly, and his fish
eyes middle-class. The other, on her programme next, is far more
handsome, surely: his keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> eyes have metallic glints, his hair is
glossy black; he is Italian, is he not, or else from Hungary?</p>

<p>Ah! here he comes.</p>

<p>Two heads incline, she takes an arm: they waltz.</p>

<p>This waltz, it rolls with a voluptuous rhythm, in harmony with the
rhythm of the Girl, like convoluted masses, musically vaporous and very
heavy, volutas without end and curve on curve. They dance, their curves
leave traces of caresses in the air, their undulations are a most
lascivious music. She? she is very tired, she has no strength as on her
cavalier she leans! her thought is vague, so vague along the twining
curves, vague in volutas without end, and with the contours of their
curves. These curves are turning round lasciviously; she thinks no more,
she turns, she turns, she undulates in air and in the music's kisses,
tickled by something drunken, by this air which brushes her, this
ball:&mdash;she shivers.</p>

<p>Now nothing more, her eyes see nothing; things that turn, vague things,
volutas vague without an end, and curves that drag her on in velvet
rhythms. But all the things around her turn too vaguely, too vaguely
cycles turn barbaric, mad; all of it turning, turning; and if she look
again she will be sure to fall!...</p>

<p>The waltz continues and lasciviously rolls, rolls in the dizziness of
turning things, mad cycles, and all this softness, curves that languish
fit to swoon! Feverishly and to flee the crazy dizziness of all these
vague and circumambient things, as if to save her life she keeps her
look on him.&mdash;He plunges his deep down into the great vague eyes before
him, until he sets them shuddering ... This man, his eyes are shining;
strangely beautiful, they shine with gleams fantastic, and from their
fluid comes perverted charm, burning and dominating, almost animal, and
with a glaucous glint that troubles her ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>This well-nigh bestial look upon a somewhat pensive, handsome face....
And it is she, she ... Ashamed, in spite of all her dizziness, she takes
away her eyes from him who seeks to conquer her. But all is turning, all
these things, these vague things turning, turning O too much! she shuts
her eyes to see them not, she could not open them again, the rhythms
bear her onward crossing one another, brushing some lascivious curve
again, the vagueness, O such vagueness of the crazy cycles and
lascivious curves that ravish her. Delicate titillation like a feather's
sudden touch electrifies her, half-fainting and surrendering she floats
like flotsam on his arm; this arm, that like a very soft and powerful
billow bears and cradles her; sweetly, irresistibly caresses her,
bearing her onward, circling her with a voluptuous embrace, and ... no,
no! his eyes through her closed lids she feels them, and their glaucous
flame that pierces, conquers her. This glaucous look, this virile and
determined look, it weighs upon her, haunting the soft eddyings of the
waltz,&mdash;and is not this a breath that brushes her, the stifled warmth of
a desiring breath, man's breath on her neck....</p>

<p>But the waltz bears her on in whirling, vague, voluptuousness.</p>

<br />
"The light that my embanking meadow laves<br />
Over me like a purer billow glides.<br />
Naked in its limpid and transparent waves,<br />
It is the magnifying image wherein I<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Am the diaphanous shadow of the sky.<br />
<br />
O beam!... O dream of fire that fills me ...<br />
He, my heroic vow that with emotion thrills me,<br />
Comes!... but when his flame has lapped me wholly,<br />
From over me he rises, fleeing slowly,<br />
And in my being I can hear a being die.<br />
<br />
Beautiful is the forest, whose<br />
O'er-leaning leaves temper my languid heat,<br />
Stripped by the wind of gold he strews,<br />
And myriad leaves are from each other singled,<br />
Dancing to fall upon their glancing selves,<br />
And playfully to emulate the frivolous deceit<br />
Of a bird's pinion with my waters mingled.<br />
<br />
Breezes, trills of songbirds warbling with a breast that wells,<br />
All that lives and makes the forest ring retells<br />
The melody I murmur to my tall reed-grasses,<br />
Aery music that its spirit glasses.<br />
<br />
O forest! O sweet forest, thou invitest me to rest<br />
And linger in thy shade with moss and shavegrass dressed,<br />
Imprisoning me in swoon of soft caresses<br />
That o'er me droop thy dense and leafy tresses.<br />
<br />
But on I glide, I go, and, fretful,<br />
Pass under thee, gliding away my life forgetful.<br />
The evanescent soul, the soul where thou wert glassed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>Fades, and leaves my sealed eyes nothing of the past.<br />
<br />
Far away from me are gone<br />
All the glimpses that upon me shone.<br />
To other forests and to other lights,<br />
Shaking my hair from fall to fall, from spate to spate,<br />
I glide with hands untied, and empty-eyed,<br />
With endless hours that fetter and control my fate.<br />
<br />
Wandering shadow of a reverie banked and pent,<br />
Sister of all those whom my waves entrap,<br />
Intangible as a soul, and, like a soul,<br />
Unfit to seize, I roll<br />
Garlands of scattered memories, whose scent<br />
Dies in a bitter sap.<br />
<br />
And neither who I am nor whence I am I know ...<br />
Under my fleeting images lives but one being,<br />
That winds with all my windings whither they are fleeing ...<br />
O thou whose tired feet I have bathed, and heavy brow,<br />
And the caress of avid hands,&mdash;<br />
O passer-by, my brother listening to me now!&mdash;<br />
Hast thou not seen, from the waste mountains' threshold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">to my far sea-sands,</span><br />
Born and reborn in me, strong as the whipped flood-tides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">of love's emotion,</span><br />
The broad, unbroken current rolling me to the ocean?<br />
<br />
Hast thou not seen, force without end, immortal rhythm and rhyme,<br />
Desire impelling me beyond the bounds of Time?"<br />

Every hand that touches me I greet<br />
With kisses welcoming, caresses sweet.<br />
<br />
Thus in my crystal's naked beauty, I&mdash;<br />
With nothing save a little gold as on my lips a dye&mdash;<br />
Give myself wholly to the mouth unknown<br />
That seeks the burning of my own.<br />
<br />
Queen of joy,&mdash;queen and slave,&mdash;<br />
Mistress that taken passes on again,<br />
Mocking the love she throws to still<br />
Desire, I have blown madness at my pleasure's will<br />
To the four winds that rave.<br />
<br />
Say you that I am vain?<br />
List!<br />
I am feeble, scarcely I exist ...<br />
Yet listen: for I can be everything.<br />
<br />
This mouth, that never any kiss could close,<br />
Capriciously in subtle fires it blows,<br />
The jewelled garlands of a shadowy blossoming.<br />
<br />
Tulip of gold or ruby, dense<br />
Corolla of dark purple opulence,<br />
Stem of a lilial diamond<br />
Flowered upon a limpid pond<br />
That nothing save the beak of wood-doves troubles,<br />
I am sparkling, I am singing,&mdash;and I laugh to see,<br />
Ascending in this colourless soul of me,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>As might a dream, a thousand iridescent bubbles.<br />
<br />
For the lover drunken on my lips that burn,<br />
Whether he pour in turn<br />
The wines of gold and flame or love's wave to my rim,<br />
Drinks from my soul for ever strange to him<br />
A queenly splendour or the radiance of the skies,<br />
Or fury scorching where the harmful ruby lies<br />
In the bitter counsel of my jealous topazes.<br />
<br />
And, tears or joy, delirium, daring drunkenness,<br />
From all this passion that to his is married<br />
Nothing of me will gush unto his arid<br />
Lips, save the simple and the limpid light<br />
Whose gleam is wedded to my empty chalice.<br />
<br />
What matter? I have given Desire his cloudland palace,<br />
And on my courtesan's bare breast<br />
Love lets the hope of his diaphanous flight<br />
Languish, and softly rest ...<br />
And I laugh, the fragile, frivolous sister of Eve!<br />
For me in nights of madness drunken hands upheave<br />
Higher than all foreheads to the constellated skies,<br />
And then I am the sudden star of lies,<br />
That into troubled joys darts deep its radiant gleam&mdash;<br />
The sweet, perfidious happiness of Dream.<br />

Jewels, ribbons, naked necks,<br />

Women, undulating the soft melody<br />
Of gestures languishing, surrendering ...<br />
And the vain, scattered patter of swift words ...<br />
<br />
Silken vestures floating, faces bright,<br />
Furtive converse, gliding glances, futile kiss<br />
Of eyes that flitting round alight like birds,<br />
And flee, and come again coquettishly;<br />
Laughter, and lying ... and all flying away<br />
To the strains that spin the frivolous swarm around.<br />
<br />
Lo, here the burning beauty of a rose<br />
Has fallen ...<br />
And feeble in its wasted grace it lies,<br />
Exhaling its bruised loveliness, the while,<br />
Like Love among the smiles,<br />
It dies.<br />
<br />
Eddying skirts, gay giddiness ... the festival is closed.<br />
While somewhat of uneasiness still palpitates,<br />
No void subsists of vanished voices;<br />
And nothing on the stained boards has remained<br />
Except a stem, a chalice,&mdash;once a rose.<br />
<br />
But the forgotten chandelier, whose grandiose soul<br />
Unto the eyes of beauty dedicates<br />
Its glorious sheaf of fires without a goal,<br />
In halls deserted charms the solitude<br />
That nascent morning sheds his pure breeze o'er-<br />

The young smile of the golden morn,<br />
That comes across the plain where wheat and rye<br />
Grow green, and with the blonde dawn intertwine ...<br />
Behold: consumed under the ruby shine<br />
In which its glory's arid flame exhausts itself,<br />

Some one here has gone to sleep.<br />
<br />
While yet the sun is at the Heaven's rim,<br />
Under the shadows of domed ilex crests,<br />
Innocent, tired, upon the happy grass he rests,<br />
And the shadow, scarcely moving over him,<br />
Prolongs around his sleep the hem of night.<br />
<br />
Who is this child thus dawning on our sight?<br />
Is it to any one among you known<br />
Whence comes this adolescent, white<br />
Traveller, who has halted with us in the night?<br />
<br />
Comes he from seas afar,<br />
Where islands are?<br />
Or from unkempt<br />
Forests, or from sterile plains,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>Whose vastness never any man has dreamt?<br />
<br />
Naked and white is he. The stones that clot<br />
The road, his feet and knees have wounded not;<br />
There is upon his brow something we dread ...<br />
Whence comes he, with his beauty dight,<br />
He who has halted with us in the night?<br />
<br />
His hair is spread<br />
Like a wave of light;<br />
His closed hand holds a flower unknown;<br />
And all his white of an enchanted thing<br />
Is like a cloud-scape doubly shown<br />
In waters mirroring.<br />
<br />
O brothers, take<br />
Care that his sleep ye do not break!<br />
<br />
But what a snow is this that trembling gleams<br />
Frail on his flank, and buries him in our sight?<br />
And these strange beams,<br />
That like a white and scintillant raiment drape<br />
His limbs in folds of light?<br />
<br />
O brothers! I have seen ... It is a wing ...<br />
Look ye: this is, immortal shape,<br />
An angel slumbering.<br />
<br />
In the light morn, where the holm its shadow flings,<br />
The wanderer adown Heaven's azure steep<br />
Has closed his mystic wings:<br />
An angel here has gone to sleep!<br />
<br />
Never a movement quivers<br />
To trouble the transparent, limpid air:<br />
Not a leaf shivers ...<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>It is an angel sleeping there.<br />
<br />
What silence! O what calm without an end!<br />
Whence did the stranger unto us descend?<br />
Did he, a weak, frail enemy advance<br />
Before the One who strikes, and wills us prone?<br />
Or were there monsters to be overthrown,<br />
Some day of courage blind, pierced with his lance,<br />
And then his wing grazed Death?<br />
But no, for with a smile his mouth uncloses;<br />
And in the silence he reposes.<br />
<br />
O let us whisper! Let the shadow's dome<br />
Lengthen the hour of sleep with its fresh gloam.<br />
Perchance his soul loved space, but tender<br />
And human still, grew weary of the bare<br />
And arid splendour of unvaulted air,<br />
And all this sun-swept ether limitless ...<br />
<br />
Sad was his heart one day, feebler his soul,<br />
His brow too heavy; and, without a goal,<br />
Wandering through deathless radiance loathing it,<br />
He closed his eyes above<br />
The dizzy vast of love,<br />
And, keeping at his flank his shamed wings,<br />
Down floating, on the earth alit.<br />
<br />
But when, awakening, to his feet he springs,<br />
Angered, his resistless wings will soar and fly,<br />
Resounding through the Azure they devour;<br />
And, virgin, with a supernatural, clear cry,<br />
He in the dawn will fade, in the infinite hour,<br />
Like the keen dream that darts through cosmos deeps,<br />
When a flaming meteor leaps,<br />
And lights the worlds between.<br />

<br />
<br />
No man knows whence, from very far,<br />
Came a man who bore a lyre,<br />
And his eyes were as bright as a madman's are,<br />
And he sang a song of fire<br />
To the short strings of his lyre,<br />
The love of women, and vain, languishing desire,<br />
Upon his lyre.<br />
<br />
His lyre was frail, and flowered with roses pale;<br />
And so sweet rose the voice of his breath,<br />
That as far as a man's eye wandereth,<br />
From the mountain to the vale,<br />
From the valley to the forest, from the forest to the plain,<br />
Ran the young men, and the lasses sprang<br />
To hear the dulcet strain of pain he sang.<br />
<br />
"He's a proud man," said all the men.<br />
"Like a soul speaking is this voice of his,<br />
So sad and tender, fit to make you swoon,<br />
His voice is like a woman's kiss!"&mdash;<br />
"Ho!" they said&mdash;said all the lasses then&mdash;<br />
"He is a lover, with his lyre!<br />
Sweetly he speaks, so sweetly with his lyre,<br />
We fain would weep, and would be dying soon...."<br />
<br />
But now the singer's voice has changed, he sings<br />
Upon the long chords of his lyre<br />
The deeds of men, and dukes, and kings,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>Warring afar from Ophir to Cathay,<br />
And over all the earth in great array,<br />
And weapons shocked by which the soul is rocked,&mdash;<br />
And golden oriflammes spread to the breeze's breath<br />
To celebrate the joy of life in death.<br />
<br />
"O!" the men, "Alas!" the lasses said,<br />
"We understand no longer what you say.<br />
Your voice that soared, like any wing<br />
Freed but now from the great paradise,<br />
Has gone,&mdash;perhaps more proudly hovering,&mdash;<br />
We know not in what country now it flies."<br />
"O!" the men, "Alas!" the lasses said.<br />
And children, string by string,<br />
Cried under dazzled skies.<br />
<br />
Now for his grave man's voice the singer tries<br />
The greatest chord of all the lyre.<br />
And to the gravest chord of all he saith<br />
Hope that for very youth soars in a breath,<br />
And stretching like a wakened beast desire....<br />
And lo! already, by the willows of the river,<br />
Beautiful Joy who passes binding crowns turns her aside.<br />
<br />
And suddenly tempestuous grief rings far and wide,<br />
Its strength awakening from the mystery of the chords<br />
Dream-voices that deliver....<br />
And lo! our fists are clenched and leaping towards<br />
Death's iron gates, and bruised recoiling thence.<br />
<br />
"Holla!" the men said; and the lasses laughed.<br />
"Holla!" the men said, "surely he is daft!<br />
He sings, he comes we know not whence;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>What would he have from us? We have no pence."<br />
(And the lasses laughed.)<br />
"Follow," the lasses said, "the werwolf we have<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">started."</span><br />
And men and maids stoned him with pebbles of the way,<br />
And, twining arms and waists, so glad and gay,<br />
Singing and laughing, all departed,<br />
Laughing and singing, laughing all the way.<br />

But now the solitude is moulding<br />
A long music folding and unfolding.<br />
<br />
Is it an unseen angel's touch? As in the grey<br />
Silence might a phantom shape's,<br />
That comes, unrolls its raiment, and escapes,<br />
A voice flees, when the breeze has touched and passed,<br />
And glides within the singing chords....<br />
As a light wind sings at a vessel's mast,<br />
The sweet breath mounting from the river towards<br />
The singer, binds a chant on the lyre's chords.<br />
<br />
It is a wing wrinkling the wave, and in it glassed:<br />
It is the vague word moving Nature through and through,<br />
And which the human lip shall never speak....<br />
<br />
And now it bears a soul into the blue;<br />
And of a sudden all the melody<br />
Rings out with such a grave accord towards<br />
The skies, that in the radiant deeps of space the chords,<br />
Magnified, no man can fathom how,<br />
Have brushed God's viewless brow!<br />

<br />
Two women on the hill-side stood,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>Where the long road winds through the wood,<br />
At dusk of day.<br />
One of them laughs, a-laughing glad and gay,<br />
One of them sings, mocking all grisly care;<br />
The other moans, and sighs in her despair,<br />
The other sobs, crying her heart away.<br />
<br />
"Ho!" (says the one) "sweet glides the breeze,<br />
My drunken heart upon it flees...."<br />
<br />
The other moans, "The wind blows chill,<br />
My heart is O! so sad and ill."<br />
<br />
One told her story to the grass-green hill:<br />
<br />
"Years and years gone my husband went from me,<br />
(Upon the breeze my laughter bounds and blows!)<br />
He went to sail upon the doleful sea,<br />
And God knows he has slain his thousand foes.<br />
But let the drunken breeze be blowing strong,<br />
He will come back with April's sun ere long,<br />
And we shall laugh at troubles o'er and done,<br />
Counting the golden booty he has won."<br />
<br />
So glad and gay, she laughs and sings her song.<br />
<br />
And the other moans in sorrow broken-hearted;<br />
The words are broken in her voice that grieves.<br />
<br />
"The wind groans; my soul with sorrow heaves;<br />
My lord, my lover he is far departed!<br />
His flesh with mine was one,<br />
His soul and mine were blent.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>And yet one day from me he went,<br />
And on my lips held out in vain,<br />
Like a drop hung on the rim<br />
Of passion's cup filled full for him,<br />
Is trembling still a kiss I gave not back again.<br />
<br />
Far, far away, upon the bloody plain,<br />
(O! in the wind the wailing wild of pain!)<br />
Perchance he fell and now he dies,&mdash;or some<br />
Woman has with her love his heart o'ercome,<br />
Some woman's eyes have robbed my happiness ...<br />
With pain and love my heart is all forlorn;<br />
I hear my sorrow and the wind's distress<br />
Blent in the baleful bluster of the corn.<br />
I know! Another woman's kisses sever<br />
His heart from mine! But what is this disgrace<br />
To me, the flesh of his flesh now and ever?<br />
Let him come back! I languish for his face.<br />
Let him come back to where his truelove lies,<br />
And every day my tears for him shall race<br />
Down on my pale hands from my withered eyes."<br />
<br />
"Ho!" says the one, (a-singing glad and gay),<br />
"Thy tears are at the wind's will borne away.<br />
See, in the valley greens the gracious spring;<br />
The warbling bird is gladdening the leaves!<br />
O let the breeze blow far thy voice that grieves,<br />
For the breeze is come, with perfumes on his wing<br />
And the meadows bloom under the April rain.<br />
Laughter! I know no more of tears and pain."<br />
<br />
"Ah!" says the other, "woe and lackaday!"<br />
<br />
"O!" says the one,&mdash;and laughing wends her way.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>Two women on the hill-side stood.<br />
<br />
And now, from the far fields and near the wood,<br />
Two wounded men come trailing up the way.<br />
No standard waves its joy before their face,<br />
No sturdy mule is bearing their array.<br />
Alone, and slowly, up the path they pace,<br />
And, drop by drop, blood marks their every trace.<br />
<br />
And of a sudden crying from the brant,<br />
The blended voices of two women pant;&mdash;<br />
And the wind may moan, and laugh the breeze,<br />
For grief and joy mingle their ecstasies.<br />
<br />
"It is my husband! God, scarce liveth he ...<br />
(My laugh is stifled dying in the breeze!)<br />
Alas! it is my husband, fainting, bruised,<br />
Drop by drop his blood has oozed ...<br />
Curst be the hour my husband went from me!<br />
Curst, curst be God who hears and sees!"<br />
<br />
Two cries of women, fury and caress,<br />
Cry without hope and cry of happiness ...<br />
<br />
"It is my lord, alive, my lover dear ...<br />
(My tears are dried, and on the breeze they flee!)<br />
O it is he indeed! My lord is here,<br />
Bruised, wounded, pitiful, with panting breath,<br />
But loyal to my heart that quivereth ...<br />
Blest be the day gives my true love to me!"<br />
<br />
And the wind may moan, and sing the breeze ...<br />
For joy and grief have blent their ecstasies.<br />
<br />
For mirrored in the evasive wave appears<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>A double brow; an angel sleeps beside<br />
The waking angel; from the plaint that died<br />

But seek not where I have strayed,<br />

My kiss falls on thy face....<br />

Like a wing that flits through space.<br />

Listen, and think! I am she<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the wonderful beam</span><br />
Of a mystery unveiled to thee.<br />

I am hot as the sun at heaven's steep,<br />

O shame! Am I stricken with terror? Absolve with the calm of thy scorn<br />

Yet once my forehead fancied, in its tender and radiant morn,<br />

<br />
I have hated thee in my terror, O Priestess of Time, O Death.<br />

And the flesh in the shock of thy billows writhes, and with stifled breath<br />

Rooted on herbless peaks, where its erect<br />
And prickly leaves, austerely cold and dumb,<br />
Hold the slow, scaly serpent in respect,<br />
The Gothic thistle, while the insects' hum<br />
Sounds far off, rears above the rock it scorns<br />
Its rigid virtue for the Heavens to see.<br />
The towering boulders guard it. And the bee<br />
Makes honey from the blossoms on its thorns.<br />

Fed by the effervescence<br />
Of poisonous putrescence,<br />
Flourish the saprophytes in mould and must.<br />
<br />
Plants without roots and with no leaves of green,<br />
Souls without faith or hope&mdash;they thrust<br />
Protuberances rank with lust,<br />
Inert, venene.<br />
<br />
And if there is not death in all of them,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>It is because some sect among them breeds<br />
From less putrescent wood fallen from the stem<br />
Of the Living Tree whose severed bough still feeds.<br />
<br />
In the autumnal thicket, thinned<br />
Along its mournful arches by the wind,<br />
No longer to dead twigs but sapwood quick,<br />
Corrupting trunks that time left whole,<br />
The reeking parasites in millions stick,<br />
Like to the carnal ill that gnaws the soul<br />
Of those who at the feet of women fawn.<br />
<br />
And Hell has blessed their countless spawn.<br />
<br />
And though they cannot reach the surging tops<br />
Of the unshaken columns of the Church,<br />
In spreading crops<br />
The parasites with poison smirch<br />
And mottle with strange stains the fruits<br />
The Monstrance ripens in the groves of Rome.<br />
<br />
Trusting that ancient orchard's sainted roots,<br />
Whoever of the leprous apples eats<br />
Shall feel his faith grow darkened with a gloam<br />
That filters heresy's corroding sweets.<br />
<br />
More hideous than saprophytes,<br />
And therefore for the sacrilege more fit,<br />
Upon the Corn and Vinestock sit<br />
Minute and miserable parasites;<br />
And o'er the Eucharist their tiny bellies,<br />
To cat and crimson it, have crept.<br />
Their occult plague has for three hundred years<br />
Eaten the very hope of mystic ears,<br />
Wherever the Christian Harvester has slept.<br />

In the brewing-vat of barren exegeses<br />
Some new-found yeast for ever effervesces,<br />
The saints whose blood turns sick and rots,<br />
Waiting till a second Nero shall<br />
For their cremation light a golden carnival,<br />
Behold their bodies decked with livid spots.<br />

What use is speech, what use is it to say<br />
Words that without an echo die away,<br />
And only leave vain sadness after?<br />
All a forest of shadow rings with laughter,<br />
If thou but move thy hand to grasp at life!<br />
<br />
My love, the path on which we laugh with life<br />
Pales in a doubt befogged with roads that leads not thorough;<br />
The night is triumphing with stars, towards to-morrow!<br />
In the night, thou sayest, shadowy terrors fall.<br />
Be undeceived, there is no night:<br />
There is only multiform, enormous light,<br />
And the stars are there, for thee to be drunk withal!<br />

The leaves are paling in the twilight chill:<br />
A mystic something in the air is swimming;<br />
Our eyes with happy tears are over-brimming;<br />
And now the source grows timid, and is still.<br />
The shadow makes the world so fair and frail;<br />
Wouldst thou not, like a banner on the gale,<br />
Be fain to shake thy heart out tenderly?&mdash;<br />
But no, say nothing: silence is a veil<br />
For fervent thoughts that utterance only mars.<br />
Let us sit hand in hand, and converse be<br />
Without a word under the peace of stars.<br />

Feverish as the earth is with the sun.<br />

My heart leaps like a beast of light, and rears<br />
And madly o'er the royal road careers,<br />
Where my desires' processional altars are.<br />
Your flesh is quivering and to mine replies,<br />
Dearest, and glassed within your great pale eyes<br />
Is Heaven immensely blue and deep and far.<br />

Kiss me! The hour is sweet, and pure our kiss.<br />

Hath not this evening that old loveliness?<br />

Hearts had been beating long before they spoke,<br />

The treasure of our hearts this one deep look<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Delivered up! Our secrets were in this</span><br />

"Still, thou poor child, this childish fear of me?<br />

Are these a shadow's hands that on it rest?<br />

Is it a phantom's voice that soothes thy grief?<br />

Breathe its terrestrial odour! Part my hair,<br />
And take my veil away and make me bare!<br />
Thou canst not soil my wings, nor stain the snow<br />

Come, in so fair an evening, spend the treasure<br />

Slow falls the eve; the hour is grave, profound.<br />
The sweet, sad cuckoo makes the air resound<br />
With his two notes with springtide languor filled;<br />
And the tall pines, by eddying breezes thrilled,<br />
Tremble, as ocean echoes in a shell.<br />
Else all is hushed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">I walk with heart unwell.</span><br />
Slowly the shadow on my path descends.<br />
I loiter o'er familiar forest bends,<br />
Whose calm grows deeper with the darkening west,<br />
O such a calm I feel my own unrest<br />
Melt in the peace of landscapes unforeseen;<br />
And in the east eve clothes with azure sheen<br />
The slender uplands with their billowing chain,<br />
Whose silhouettes shut in the distant plain;<br />
And on their tops their cloak of forests gleams<br />
Through the thin veil of mist that o'er them streams.<br />
And all is vague, the ideal form of things<br />
Shimmers divine in deep imaginings,<br />
Gladdening the eye with grace ineffable;<br />
Seeing them, in the enchanted world we dwell<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>Of soulless, happy beings who possess<br />
The calm we cry for of forgetfulness,<br />
We who desire in desolate hearts that pine,<br />
This sovereign gift of peace that makes divine;<br />
And most at eve, when quiet nights of spring<br />
Enchant the sky, the forest, and the ling.<br />
The forest's darkness sways me at its will;<br />
And with a holy and unfathomed thrill<br />
I feel a dizzy longing grow in me:<br />
O not to think! nor wish! O not to be!...<br />

Time goes, poor soul, and sterile are thy vows.<br />
After our outwatched nights and feverish brows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What do we know, save that we nothing know?</span><br />
<br />
Even as a child a butterfly will chase,<br />
Far have I strayed in many a flowering place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And here I tremble in the afterglow.</span><br />
<br />
Yet not despairing in my feebleness,<br />
But hoping that the Master still will bless<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The will to do good that my efforts show.</span><br />

Does thy heart, Tasso, burn for thy Princess?<br />
Strive to refine this obscure tenderness,<br />
Of which she can accept the flower alone.<br />
Save it make nobler, I no love can own.<br />
Certes, among the gifts that fate bestows,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>And the least lovely, as a poet knows,<br />
<br />
Some are an offered prey that passions take.<br />
But there are others which, if seized, do break;<br />
And of these supreme gifts love is the best.<br />
If thou indeed dost love me, 'ware thee lest<br />
Thy heart forget the reverence it owes,<br />
Then may it love, and in love find repose.<br />

O thinker! Thou whose heart hath not withstood,<br />
For the first time, Spring's beauty in the wood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And who thyself wilt therefore not forgive,</span><br />
<br />
Thy days have passed in pondering o'er the great<br />
Enigma man proposes to his fate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And books from life have made thee fugitive.</span><br />
<br />
What boots? Leave to the gods their secret yet,<br />
And, while thou livest, taste without regret<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweetness of this simple word: To live.</span><br />

He knows dreams never kept their promise yet.<br />
Henceforth without desire, without regret,<br />
He cons the page of sober tenderness<br />
In which some poet, skilled in life's distress,<br />
Breathed into olden, golden verse his sighs.<br />
Sometimes he lifts his head, and feeds his eyes,<br />
With all the wonderment that wise men know,<br />
On fields, and clouds that over forests go,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>And with their calmness sated is his thought.<br />
<br />
He knows how dearly fair renown is bought:<br />
He too, in earlier days of stinging strength,<br />
Sought that vain victory to find at length<br />
Sadness at his desire's precipitous brink....<br />
Of what avail, he thought, to act and think,<br />
When human joy holds all in one rapt look?<br />
His mind at peace reads Nature like a book.<br />
He smiles, remembering his youth's unrest,<br />
And, though none know it, he is wholly blest.<br />

<br />
<br />
When, worn with unregenerate delights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The kisses of fair youths grow dull and sicken,</span><br />
They seek, fatigued with hope and outwatched nights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A bed of love that shall the senses quicken.</span><br />
<br />
White bed of love with pillows rich with lace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Caressing curtains sheltering dreamless blisses,</span><br />
And, to grow better from the bought embrace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon their wasted brows long trembling kisses.</span><br />
<br />
Calmer than autumn heavens the eyes they crave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In which the bitterness of theirs shall vanish,</span><br />
Lips of a speech impassionate, suave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which their sick sorrows shall assuage and banish.</span><br />
<br />
Love should be night, and hushed forgetfulness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never with follies of the past upbraided,</span><br />
Hope still renewed consoling the distress<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of dreams come true and in fulfilment faded.</span><br />
<br />
Nor light, nor noise; but in the happy room,<br />
With tapestry the walls to sleep beguiling,<br />
To kiss the long hands of the mistress whom<br />
A plain gown clothes, and who is faintly smiling!<br />
<br />
Once they have seen her, and to hear her speak<br />
They hoped for her and Heaven, and knelt before her;<br />
But love's old burden makes their soul so weak<br />
That save with sighs they never dare implore her.<br />

<br />
Oft on my rural youth I dwell in fancy.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye gods who for our deepest feelings care,</span><br />
If fields and forests evermore entrance me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is because you set my birthplace there.</span><br />
<br />
With what a love up-welling sweet and tender<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the august face of earth mine eyes</span><br />
Lingered, and drank her solitary splendour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bathed in the radiance of calm summer skies!</span><br />
<br />
All was excitement! Valleys richly rounded;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The undulating, broadly breasted hills;</span><br />
The vast plains which the veiled horizon bounded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lit by the silver flash of restless rills.</span><br />
<br />
But you, ye forests, filled me most with craving!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pang I felt still to my memory cleaves,</span><br />
When I beheld your endless tree-tops waving,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As underneath the wind the ocean heaves!</span><br />
<br />
And at your wafted murmuring, I, to capture<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your reachless vast, my arms would open dart,</span><br />
Crying in sudden, overpowering rapture:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The world is less immense than my own heart!..."</span><br />
<br />
Do not accuse of pride, O Nature! Mother!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My fleeting youth. Not vain was my unrest:</span><br />
Of all thy mortal sons there is no other<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath strained himself more fondly to thy breast.</span><br />
<br />
The summer sun has scorched my skin, and daring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has chiselled on my face its stubborn force;</span><br />
In foaming floods I bathed, my body baring;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on the mountains braved the tempests hoarse.</span><br />
<br />
All manly pleasures that our being fashion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the rough shock of elements uncouth,</span><br />
All of them I have known with headlong passion;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With lust of struggle pulsed my arduous youth.</span><br />
<br />
Intoxicating was the zest that thrilled me.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What matter if I let the fervour seize</span><br />
My quivering soul? The bitter joy that filled me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whipped and exalted me, and left no lees.</span><br />
<br />
For I had dreamt all phases of existence!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All that was frail and pent in me with scorn</span><br />
I cast aside, and looked towards the distance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where dawned the fate for which my mind was born.</span><br />
<br />
Was it a vain dream? O you centaurs smiting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With roving hoofs your rocks and herbless sods,</span><br />
O you whose shape, a man's and beast's uniting,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shelters a secret fire that makes you gods!</span><br />
<br />
You who quaffed life with its abundance drunken!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your transports I have known in olden days,</span><br />
In evenings when, like you in silence sunken,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I drove along the darkened forest ways!</span><br />
<br />
In me, ye savage gods, your strength was seething;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, when a sacred madness through me ran,</span><br />
In the pent breath the foliage was breathing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I deemed me one of you, I mortal man.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
In smoky inns whose loft is reached by ladders,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with a grimy ceiling splashed by shocks</span><br />
Of hanging hams, black-puddings, onions, bladders,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rosaries of stuffed game, capons, geese, and cocks</span><br />
Around a groaning table sit the gluttons<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before the bleeding viands stuck with forks,</span><br />
Already loosening their waistcoat buttons,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With wet mouths when from flagons leap the cork</span><br />
Teniers, and Brackenburgh, and Brauwer, shaken<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With listening to Jan Steen's uproarious wit,</span><br />
Holding their bellies dithering with bacon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wiping their chins, watching the hissing spit.</span><br />
Their heavy-bodied Hebes, with their curving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bosoms in linen white without a stain,</span><br />
Are going round, and in long jets are serving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wine that a sunbeam filters through the pane,</span><br />
Before it sets on fire the kettles' paunches<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Queens of Tippling are these women, whom</span><br />
Their swearing lovers, greedy of their haunches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Belabour as befits their youth in bloom,</span><br />
With sweating temples, blazing eyes, and lolling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tongue that keeps singing songs obscenely gay,</span><br />
With brandished fists, bodies together rolling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blows fit to bruise their carcases, while they,</span><br />
With mouth for songs aye ready, throat for bumpers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blood for ever level with their skins,</span><br />
Dance fit to split the floor, they are such jumpers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And butt their dancer as around he spins,</span><br />
And lick his face in kisses endless seeming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then fall with ransacked corsage, wet with heat.</span><br />
A smell of bacon fat is richly steaming<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the huge platters charged with juicy meat;</span><br />
The roasts are passed around, in gravy swimming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under the noses of the guests, and passed</span><br />
Around again, with fresh relays of trimming.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the kitchen drudges wash up fast</span><br />
The platters to be sent back to the table;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dressers bulge, crowded with crockery;</span><br />
The cellars hold as much as they are able;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And round the estrade where this agape</span><br />
In glowing red, from pegs hang baskets, ladles,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strainers, and saucepans, candlesticks, and flasks.</span><br />
Two monkeys in a corner show their navels,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Throning, with glass in hand, on two twin casks;</span><br />
A mellow light on every angle glimmers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shines on the door-knob, through the great keyhole,</span><br />
Clings to a pestle, filters through the skimmers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is jewelled on the monster gala bowl,</span><br />
And slanting on the heated hearthstone sickens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where, o'er the embers, turns to brown the flesh</span><br />
Of rosy sucking-pigs and fat cock-chickens,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That whet the edge of appetite afresh.</span><br />
From dawn to eve, from eve to dawn, and after,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The masters with their women revel hold&mdash;</span><br />
Women who play a farce of opulent laughter:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farce cynical, obscene, with sleeves uprolled,</span><br />
In corsage ript a flowering gorge not hiding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Belly that shakes with jollity, bright eyes.</span><br />
Noises of orgy and of rut are gliding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rumbling, and hissing, till they end in cries;</span><br />
A noise of jammed iron and of vessels banging;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brauwer and Steen tilt baskets on their crowns;</span><br />
Brackenburgh is two lids together clanging;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Others with pokers fiddle gridirons, clowns</span><br />
Are all of them, eager to show their mettle;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They dance round those who lie with feet in air;</span><br />
They scrape the frying-pan, they scrape the kettle;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the eldest are the steadiest gluttons there,</span><br />
Keenest in kisses, and the last to tumble;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With greasy nose they lick the casseroles;</span><br />
One of them makes a rusty fiddle grumble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose bow exhausts itself in cabrioles;</span><br />
Some are in corners vomiting, and others<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are snoring with their arms hung round their seats</span><br />
Babies are bawling for their sweating mothers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To stuff their little mouths with monster teats.</span><br />
Men, women, children, all stuffed full to bursting;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Appetites ravening, and instincts rife,</span><br />
Furies of stomach, and of throats athirsting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Debauchery, explosion of rich life,</span><br />
In which these master gluttons, never sated,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too genuine for insipidities,</span><br />
Pitching their easels lustily, created<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Between two drinking-bouts a masterpiece.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
In neckerchief and slackened apron goes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The girl to graze the cows at dawn's first peep;</span><br />
Under the willow shade herself she throws<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To finish out her sleep.</span><br />
<br />
Soon as she sinks she snores; around her brow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And naked toes the seeded grasses rise;</span><br />
Her bulging arms are folded anyhow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And round them buzz the flies.</span><br />
<br />
The insects that all heated places love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come flitting o'er the grass to bask in swarms</span><br />
Upon the mossy patch she lies above,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And by her sprawling warms.</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes her arm, with awkward empty sweep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Startles around her limbs the gratified</span><br />
Murmur of bees; but, greedy still of sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">She turns to the other side.</span><br />
<br />
The heavy, fleshy flowers the cattle browse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Frame in the sleeping woman as she dreams;</span><br />
She has the heavy slowness of her cows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Her eye with their peace gleams.</span><br />
<br />
Strength, that the trunk of oaks with knots embosses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shines, as the sap does, in her; and her hair</span><br />
Is browner than barley in the fields that tosses,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Or the sand in the pathways there.</span><br />
<br />
Her hands are raw, and red, and chapped; the blood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That through her tanned limbs rolls its waves of heat,</span><br />
Lashes her throat, and lifts her breasts, as would<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The wind lift bending wheat.</span><br />
<br />
Noon with a kiss of gold her rest surprises,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Low willow branches o'er her shoulders lean,</span><br />
And blend, while heavier slumber in her eyes is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With her brown hair their green.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With ruddy teats, and bodies like flowers blown;</span><br />
Thy proudest masterpieces tell us how.<br />
<br />
Whether a goddess glimmers from thy painting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or nymphs with dripping hair a shepherd sees</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rising among the lonely irides,</span><br />
Or sailors to the sirens' kisses fainting,<br />

Or females with full contours symbolizing<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These are the Masteries love-born in thy heart,</span><br />
The wenches of thy colours' gormandizing.<br />

And to create their bodies' carnal splendour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Naked, and fat, and unashamed, thy brush</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under their clear and glossy skin made blush</span><br />

A fire of unimagined colours tender.<br />
<br />
They were a focussed light that flashed and glinted;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their eyes were kindled at the stars, and on</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy canvases their bosoms rose and shone,</span><br />
Like great bouquets of flesh all rosy-tinted.<br />
<br />
Sweating with love they rolled about a clearing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Mid in the wood, or bathed their feet in springs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While in the thickets full of noise of wings,</span><br />
Satyrs were prowling and through branches leering,<br />
<br />
And hid their legs, salacious, shagged, distorted;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their eyes, like sparks holing the darkness, lit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some leafy corner, their long mouths were slit</span><br />
With greasy smiles, their lustful nostrils snorted,<br />
<br />
Till, dogs in rut, they leapt to their bitches; these<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Feign flight, and shiver coldly, blushing roses,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pushing the satyr off the part that closes,</span><br />
Squeezing their thighs together under his knees.<br />
<br />
And some, by madness more than his ignited,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rounding their naked haunches, and rich flesh</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of glorious croups beneath a showering mesh</span><br />
Of golden hair, to wild assaults invited.<br />

The bodies of your beauties richly rounded.<br />
<br />
No pallid women sunk in listless poses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Morosely on your canvases are seen,</span><br />

<br />
With foreheads sad as is the day's declining,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sad as a dolorous music faints and dies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With heavy-lidded, sick and glassy eyes,</span><br />
In which consumption and despair are pining,<br />
<br />
And false, affected grace of bodies faded<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the sofas where their time they pass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In scented dressing-gowns of taffetas,</span><br />
And in chemises with a dear lace braided.<br />
<br />
Nothing your brushes knew of painted faces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor of indecency, nor of the nice</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hints of a cunning and perverted vice</span><br />
Which with its winking eye our art debases,<br />
<br />
Nor of the pedlar Venuses whose draping<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor corners of a venal flesh that glints</span><br />
In nests out of the low-necked dress escaping,<br />

Pricking, suggestive themes you knew not, faintings<br />

The pulsing women, masters, of your paintings,<br />

In landscapes bright, or waited on by pages<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crimsonly clad in panelled halls with gold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or in the purple sumptuousness unrolled</span><br />
Of the god-guarded, mellow classic ages,<br />
<br />
Your women sweated health; they were serenely<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crimson with blood, and white with corpulence;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ruts they did hold in leashed obedience,</span><br />

To see the sugared idyll chastening<br />
The pastels of a Louis Quinze salon,<br />
But dirty, gross, and bestial&mdash;as they are.<br />
<br />
Penned round some market town in villages,<br />
They know not them who traffic in the next,<br />
But hold them enemies to cheat and rogue.<br />
Their fatherland? Not one believes in it,<br />
Except that it makes soldiers of their sons,<br />
To steal their labour for a span of years.<br />
What is the fatherland to yokels? They<br />
See only, in a corner of their brains,<br />
Vaguely, the king, magnificent man of gold,<br />
In the braided velvet of his purple robes,<br />
A sceptre, and gemmed crowns escutcheoning<br />
The panelled walls of gilded palaces,<br />
Guarded by sentinels with tasselled swords.<br />
This do they know of power. It is enough.<br />
And for the rest their heavy feet would march<br />
In clogs through duty, liberty, and law.<br />
In everything by instinct ankylosed,<br />
A dirty almanac is all they read;<br />
And though they hear the distant cities roaring,<br />
So terrified are they by revolutions,<br />
That they are riveted to serfdom's chains,<br />
Fearing, if they should rear, the iron heel.<br />
<br />
Along the black roads hollowed out with ruts,<br />
Dung-heaps in front and cinder-heaps behind,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Stretch with low roofs and naked walls their huts<br />
Under the buffeting wind and lashing rain.<br />
These are their farms. And yonder soars the church,<br />
Stained, to the north, with ooze of verdigris,<br />
And farther, squared with ditches, lie their fields,<br />
Fertile in patches, thanks to fat manure,<br />
And to the harrow's unrelenting teeth.<br />
There they keep tilling with their obstinate hands<br />
The black glebe mined by moles, and rotten with<br />
Detritus, pregnant with the autumn's sperm.<br />
With dripping brow they drive the spade in deep,<br />
Doubled above the furrows they must sow,<br />
Under the hail of March that whips their back.<br />
And in the summer, when the ripe rye rocks<br />
With golden glints under the pouring sun,<br />
Here, in the fire of long and torrid days,<br />
Their restless sickle shaves the vast wheat-field,<br />
While from their wrinkled foreheads runs the sweat,<br />
Opening their skin from shoulders down to hips;<br />
Noon darts its brazier rays upon their heads;<br />
So raw the heat is that in meslin fields<br />
The too dry ears burst open, and the beasts,<br />
Their necks with gadflies riddled, pant in the sun.<br />
And let November slow to die arrive,<br />
Rolling his hectic rattle through deaf woods,<br />
Howling his sobs and ending not his moans,<br />
Until his death-knell sounds&mdash;still runs their sweat.<br />
Always anew preparing future crops,<br />
Under a sky spouting from swollen clouds,<br />
While the north wind tears big holes in the woods,<br />
And sweeps the broken stubble from the fields,<br />
So that their bodies soon in ruin fall:<br />
Let them be young and comely, broadly built,<br />
Winter that chills, summer that calcines them,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Makes their limbs loathsome and their lungs short-breathed;<br />
Or old, and bearing the down-weighing years,<br />
With blear eyes, broken backs, and useless arms,<br />
And horror stamped upon their hedgehog face,<br />
They stagger under the ruin-loving wind.<br />
And when Death opens unto them its doors;<br />
Their coffin sliding into the soft earth<br />
Seems only to contain a thing twice dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
II.<br />
<br />
On evenings when through eddying skies the wind<br />
Is whirling the swarming snow across the fields,<br />
Grey-headed farmers sit in reckonings lost,<br />
Near lamps from which a thread of smoke ascends.<br />
The kitchen is unkempt and slatternly:<br />
A string of dirty children by the stove<br />
Gorge the spilt remnants of the evening meal;<br />
Mangy and bony cats lick dishes clean;<br />
Cocks make their beaks ring upon pewter plates;<br />
Damp soaks the leprous walls; and on the hearth<br />
Four flickering logs are twisting meagre shanks<br />
Dying with listless tongues of pale red ray;<br />
The old men's heads are full of bitter thoughts.<br />
"For all the seasons unremitting toil,<br />
With all hands at the plough a hundred years,<br />
The farm has passed from father on to son,<br />
And, with good years and bad, remains the same,<br />
Jogging along upon the brink of ruin."<br />
This is what gnaws and bites them with slow tooth.<br />
So like an ulcer hate is in their hearts,<br />
Patient and cunning hate with smiling face.<br />
Their frank and loud good nature hatches rage;<br />
Wickedness glimmers in their icy looks;<br />
They stink of the rancorous gall that, age by age,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Their sufferings have collected in their souls.<br />
Keen are they on the slightest gain, and mean;<br />
Since they can not enrich themselves by work,<br />
Stinginess makes their hearts hard, their hearts fetid;<br />
And black their mind is, set on petty things,<br />
And stupid and confounded before great;<br />
As they had never raised their eyes unto<br />
The sun, and seen magnificent sunsets<br />
Spread on the evening, like a crimson lake.<br />
<br />
<br />
III.<br />
<br />
But kermesse is for them a festival,<br />
Even for the dirtiest, the stingiest,<br />
There go the lads to keep the wenches warm.<br />
A huge meal, greased with bacon and hot sauces,<br />
Makes their throats salty and enflames their thirst.<br />
They roll in the inns, with rounded guts, and hearts<br />
Aflame, and break the jaws and necks of those<br />
Come from the neighbouring town, who try, by God!<br />
To lick the village girls too greedily,<br />
And gorge a plate of beef that is not theirs.<br />
<br />
Savings are squandered&mdash;for the girls must dance,<br />
And every chap must treat his mate, until<br />
The bottles strew the floor in ugly heaps.<br />
The proudest of their strength drain huge beer-mugs,<br />
Their faces fire-plated, darting fright,<br />
Horrid with bloodshot eyes and clammy mouth,<br />
In the dark rumbling revels kindle suns.<br />
The orgy grows. A stinking urine foams<br />
In a white froth along the causey chinks.<br />
Like slaughtered beasts are reeling topers floored.<br />
Some are with short steps steadying their gait;<br />
While others solo bawl a song's refrain,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Hindered by hiccoughing and vomiting.<br />
<br />
In brawling groups they ramble through the town,<br />
Calling the wenches, catching hold of them,<br />
Hugging them, shoving at them,<br />
Letting them go, and pulling them back in rut,<br />
Throwing them down with flying skirts and legs.<br />
In the taverns&mdash;where the smoke curls like grey fog<br />
And climbs to the ceiling, where the gluing sweat<br />
Of heated, unwashed bodies, and their smells<br />
Dull window-panes and pewter-pots with steam&mdash;<br />
To see battalions of couples crowd<br />
In growing numbers round the painted tables,<br />
It looks as if their crush would smash the walls.<br />
More furiously still they go on swilling,<br />
Stamping and blustering and raging through<br />
The cries of the heavy piston and shrill flute.<br />
Yokels in blue smocks, old hags in white bonnets,<br />
And livid urchins smoking pipes picked up,<br />
All of them jostle, jump, and grunt like pigs.<br />
And sometimes sudden wedges of new-comers<br />
Crush in a corner the quadrille that looks,<br />
So unrestrained it is, like a mixed fight.<br />
Then try they who can bawl the loudest, who<br />
Can push the tidal wave back to the wall,<br />
Though with a knife's thrust he should stab his man.<br />
But the band now redoubles its loud din,<br />
Covers the quarrelling voices of the lads,<br />
And mingles all in leaping lunacy.<br />
They calm down, joke, touch glasses, drunk as lords.<br />
The women in their turn get hot and drunk,<br />
Lust's carnal acid in their blood corrodes,<br />
And in these billowing bodies, surging backs,<br />
Freed instinct grows to such a heat of rut,<br />
That to see lads and lasses wriggling and writhing,<br />
With jostling bodies, screams, and blows of fists,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Crushing embraces, biting kisses, to see them<br />
Rolling dead drunk into the corners, wallowing<br />
Upon the floor, knocking themselves against<br />
The panels, sweating, and frothing at the lips,<br />
Their two hands, their ten fingers ransacking<br />
And emptying torn corsages, it seems&mdash;<br />
Lust is being lit at the black fire of rape.<br />
Before the sun burns with red flames, before<br />
The white mists fall in swaths, the reeking inns<br />
Turn the unsteady revellers out of doors.<br />
The kermesse in exhaustion ends, the crowd<br />
Wend their way homewards to their sleeping farms,<br />
Screaming their oaths of parting as they go.<br />
The aged farmers too, with hanging arms,<br />
Their faces daubed with dregs of wine and beer,<br />
Stagger with zigzag feet towards their farms<br />
Islanded in the billowing seas of wheat.<br />

You melancholy fogs of winter roll<br />
Your pestilential sorrow o'er my soul,<br />
And swathe my heart with your long winding-sheet,<br />
And drench the livid leaves beneath my feet,<br />
While far away upon the heaven's bounds,<br />
Under the sleeping plain's wet wadding, sounds<br />
A tired, lamenting angelus that dies<br />
With faint, frail echoes in the empty skies,<br />
So lonely, poor, and timid that a rook,<br />
Hid in a hollow archstone's dripping nook,<br />
Hearing it sob, awakens and replies,<br />
Sickening the woeful hush with ghastly cries,<br />
Then suddenly grows silent, in the dread<br />
That in the belfry tower the bell is dead.<br />

With rearing, galloping, mad, milky clouds.<br />
<br />
The whole, clear day, day without mist or rain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With leaping manes, gilt flanks, and fiery croups,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a flight of pallid silver and foam, their troops</span><br />
Career across the ether's azure plain.<br />
<br />
And still their ardour grows, until the eve's<br />
Black gesture cuts the vast of space, and heaves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their masses towards the squall that landward blares,</span><br />
<br />
While the ample sun of June, fallen from Heaven's vault,<br />
Writhes, bleeding, in their vehement assault,<br />

<br />
My verses I will weave as, at their doors<br />

Your blood was theirs, when in the mazy gloaming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under some star that bit the brazen sky,</span><br />
They heard a stranger in the sea-fog roaming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hailed some Hercules astray and shy;</span><br />

With haggard eyes, the evening magnifying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The house-fronts, and the blackening church-spire.</span><br />
<br />
The hour is dead where in some never-crowded<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">City by time extinguished, desolate,</span><br />
They live immured in walls by mourning shrouded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hear the monumental hinges grate.</span><br />
<br />
Haggard and lone, they gaze at Death unbeaten,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like grim old wolves, the hieratic sick;</span><br />
Life and its days identic they have eaten,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>

They ask: "Is happiness not in endurance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of wilful suffering, suffering loved with lust?"</span><br />
<br />
Of old they felt their hearts go out to others;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Benevolent, they pitied alien griefs;</span><br />
And, like apostles, loved their suffering brothers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And feared their pride, cabined in dead beliefs.</span><br />
<br />
But now they think that love is more cemented<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By cruelty than kindness, which is vain.</span><br />
What of the few, chance tears they have prevented?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How many more have flowed? Decreed is pain.</span><br />
<br />
Empty the golden islands are, where lingers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In golden mist Dream in a mantle spun</span><br />

<br />
<br />
With hands on oars the ferryman<br />
Strove where the stubborn current ran,<br />
With a green reed between his teeth.<br />
<br />
But she who hailed him from the bank,<br />
Beyond the waves, among the rushes rank<br />
That rim the rolling heath,<br />
Into the mists receded more and more.<br />
<br />
The windows, with their eyes,<br />
And the dials of the towers upon the shore,<br />
Watched him, with doubled back,<br />
Straining and toiling at the oar,<br />
<br />
And heard his muscles crack.<br />
Of a sudden broke an oar,<br />
Which the current bore<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
On heavy waves down to the sea.<br />
<br />
And she who hailed him from the mist,<br />
In the blustering wind, appeared<br />
More madly still her arms to twist,<br />
Towards him who never neared.<br />
<br />
The ferryman took to the oar remaining<br />
With such a might,<br />
That all his body cracked with straining,<br />
And his heart shook with feverish fright.<br />
<br />
A sudden shock, the rudder tore,<br />
And the current bore<br />
This remnant to the sea.<br />
<br />
The windows on the shore,<br />
Like eyes with fever great,<br />
And the dials of the towers, those widows straight<br />
That in their thousands throng<br />
A river bank, were obstinately staring<br />
At this mad fellow obstinately daring<br />
His crazy voyage to prolong.<br />
<br />
And she who hailed him there with chattering teeth,<br />
Howled and howled in the mists of night,<br />
With head stretched out in frantic fright<br />
To the unknown, the vast, and rolling heath.<br />
<br />
The ferryman, as a statue stands,<br />
Bronze in the storm that paled his blood,<br />
With the one oar firm in his hands,<br />
Beat the waves, and bit the flood.<br />
His old hallucinated eyes<br />
See the lit distances rejoice,<br />
Whence reaches him the lamentable voice,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Under the freezing skies.<br />
<br />
His last oar breaks,<br />
His last oar the current takes,<br />
Like a straw, down to the sea.<br />
<br />
The ferryman exhausted sank<br />
Upon his bench, with sweat that poured,<br />
His loins with vain exertion sore,<br />
A high wave struck on the lee-board,<br />
He looked, behind him lay the bank:<br />
He had not left the shore.<br />
<br />
The windows and the dials gazed,<br />
With eyes they opened wide, amazed,<br />
Where all his strength to ruin ran;<br />
But the old, stubborn ferryman<br />
Kept all the same, for God knows when,<br />
The green reed in his teeth, even then.<br />
<br />

<a name="THE_RAIN_2" id="THE_RAIN_2"></a>THE RAIN.<br />
<br />
<br />
As reeled from an exhaustless bobbin, the long rain,<br />
Interminably through the long gray day,<br />
Lines the green window pane<br />
With its long threads of gray,<br />
The reeled, exhaustless rain,<br />
The long rain,<br />
The rain.<br />
<br />
It has been ravelling out, since last sunset,<br />
Rags hanging soft and low<br />
From sulky skies of jet.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Unravelling, patient, slow,<br />
Upon the roads, since last sunset,<br />
On roads and streets,<br />
Continual sheets.<br />
<br />
Along the leagues that wind<br />
Through quiet suburbs to the fields behind,<br />
Along the roads interminably bending,<br />
In funeral procession, drenched, resigned,<br />
Toiling, bathed in sweat and steam,<br />
Vehicles with tilted coverings are wending;<br />
In ruts so regular,<br />
And parallel so far<br />
By night to join the firmament they seem,<br />
The water drips hour after hour,<br />
The spouts gush, and the trees shower,<br />
With long rain wet,<br />
With rain tenacious yet.<br />
<br />
Rivers o'er rotten dikes are brimming<br />
Upon the meadows where drowned hay is swimming;<br />
The wind is whipping walnut trees and alders,<br />
And big black oxen wading stand<br />
Deep in the water of the polders,<br />
And bellow at the writhen sky;<br />
And evening is at hand,<br />
Bringing its shadows to enfold the plain, and lie<br />
Clustered at the washed tree's root;<br />
And ever falls the rain,<br />
The long rain,<br />
As fine and dense as soot.<br />
<br />
The long rain,<br />
The long rain falls afresh;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
And its identic thread<br />
Weaves mesh by mesh<br />
A raiment making naked shred by shred<br />
The cottages and farmyards gray<br />
Of hamlets crumbling fast away;<br />
A bunch of linen rags that hang down sick<br />
Upon a loosely planted stick;<br />
Here a blue dovecote to the roof that cleaves;<br />
Sinister window panes<br />
Plastered with paper rank with mildew stains;<br />
Dwellings whose regular eves<br />
Form crosses on their gable ends of stone;<br />
Uniform, melancholy mills,<br />
Standing like horns upon their hills;<br />
Chapels, and spires with ivy overgrown;<br />
The rain<br />
The long rain<br />
Winter-long beneath them burrows.<br />
<br />
The rain, in lines,<br />
The long, gray rain untwines<br />
Its watery tresses o'er its furrows,<br />
The long rain<br />
Of countries old,<br />
Torpid, eternally unrolled.<br />

<a name="THE_FISHERMEN" id="THE_FISHERMEN"></a>THE FISHERMEN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Up from the sea a flaky, dank,<br />
Thickening fog rolls up, and chokes<br />
Windows and closed doors, and smokes<br />
Upon the slippery river bank.<br />
<br />
Drowned gleams of gas-lamps shake and fall<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Where rolls the river's carrion;<br />
The moon looks like a corpse, and on<br />
The heaven's rim its burial.<br />
<br />
But flickering lanterns now and then<br />
Light up and magnify the backs,<br />
Bent obstinately in their smacks,<br />
Of the old river fishermen,<br />
Who all the time, from last sunset,<br />
For what night's fishing none can know,<br />
Have cast their black and greedy net,<br />
Where silent, evil waters flow.<br />
<br />
Deep down beyond the reach of eye<br />
Fates of Evil gathering throng,<br />
Which lure the fishers where they lie<br />
To fish for them with patience strong,<br />
True to their task of simple toiling<br />
In contradictory fogs embroiling.<br />
<br />
And o'er them peal the minutes stark,<br />
With heavy hammers peal their knells,<br />
The minutes sound from belfry bells,<br />
The minutes hard of autumn dark,<br />
The minutes list.<br />
<br />
And the black fishers in their ships,<br />
In their cold ships, are clad in shreds;<br />
Down their cold nape their old hat drips<br />
And drop by drop in water sheds<br />
All the mist.<br />
<br />
Their villages are numb and freeze;<br />
Their huts are all in ruin sunk,<br />
And the willows and the walnut-trees<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
The winds of the west have whipped and shrunk;<br />
And not a bark comes through the dark,<br />
And never a cry through the void midnight,<br />
That floated, humid ashes blight.<br />
<br />
And never helping one another,<br />
Never brother hailing brother,<br />
Never doing what they ought,<br />
For himself each fisher's thought:<br />
And the first draws his net, and seizes<br />
All the fry of his poverty;<br />
And the next drags up, as keen as he,<br />
The empty bottoms of diseases;<br />
Another opens out his net<br />
To griefs that on the surface swim;<br />
And another to his vessel's rim<br />
Pulls up the flotsam of regret.<br />
<br />
The river churns, league after league,<br />
Along the dikes, and runs away,<br />
As it has done so many a day,<br />
To the far horizon of fatigue;<br />
Upon its banks skins of black clay<br />
By night perspire a poison draught;<br />
The fogs are fleeces far to waft,<br />
And to men's houses journey they.<br />
<br />
Never a lantern streaks the dark,<br />
And nothing stirs in the fisher's bark,<br />
Save, nimbusing with halos of blood,<br />
The thick white felt of the clustering fogs,<br />
Silent Death, who with madness clogs<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
The brains of the fishermen on the flood.<br />
<br />
Lonely at the fog's cold heart,<br />
Each sees not each, though side by side;<br />
Their arms are tired, their vessels ride<br />
By sandbanks marked on ruin's chart.<br />
<br />
Why in the dark do they not hail each other?<br />
Why does a brother's voice console not brother?<br />
<br />
No, numb and haggard they remain,<br />
With vaulted back and heavy brain,<br />
With, by their side, their little light<br />
Rigid in the river's night.<br />
Like blocks of shadow there they arc,<br />
And never pierce their eyes afar<br />
Beyond the acrid, spongy wet;<br />
And they suspect not that above,<br />
Luring them with a magnet's love,<br />
Stars immense are shining yet.<br />
<br />
These fishers in black torment tossed,<br />
They are the men immensely lost<br />
Among the knells and far aways<br />
And far beyonds where none can gaze;<br />
And in their souls' monotonous deeps<br />
The humid autumn midnight weeps.<br />

<a name="SILENCE" id="SILENCE"></a>SILENCE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since last the summer broke above her<br />
A flash of lightning from his thunder-sheath,<br />
Silence has never left her cover<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
In the heather on the heath.<br />
<br />
Across her refuge peers the steeple,<br />
And with its fingers shakes its bells;<br />
Around her prowl the vehicles,<br />
Laden with uproarious people;<br />
Around her, where the fir-trees end,<br />
In its rut the cart-wheel grates;<br />
But never a noise has strength to rend<br />
The tense, dead space where silence waits.<br />
<br />
Since the last loud thunder weather,<br />
Silence has stirred not in the heather;<br />
And the heath, wherein the evenings sink,<br />
Beyond the endless thickets, and<br />
The purple mounds of hidden sand,<br />
Lengthens her haunts to heaven's brink.<br />
<br />
And even winds stir not the slim<br />
Larches at the marsh's rim,<br />
Where she will glass her abstract eyes<br />
In pools where wondering lilies rise;<br />
And only brushes her the clouds'<br />
Shadow when they rush in crowds,<br />
Or else the shadow of a flight<br />
Of hovering hawks at heavens' height.<br />
<br />
Since the last flash of lightning streaked the plain,<br />
Nothing has bitten, in her vast domain.<br />
<br />
And those who in her realm did roam,<br />
Whether it were in dawn or gloam,<br />
They all have felt their hearts held fast<br />
In spells of mystery she has cast.<br />
She, like an ample, final force,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Keeps on the same unbroken course;<br />
<br />
Black walls of pinewoods gloom and bar<br />
The paths of hope that gleam afar;<br />
Clusters of dreamy junipers<br />
Frighten the feet of wanderers;<br />
Malignant mazes intertwine<br />
With paths of cunning curve and line,<br />
And the sun every moment shifts<br />
The goal to which confusion drifts.<br />
<br />
Since the lightning that the storm forged bit,<br />
The bitter silence at the corners four<br />
Of the heath, has changed no whit.<br />
<br />
The shepherds with their hundred years worn out,<br />
And the spent dogs that follow them about,<br />
See her, on golden dunes where shadows flit,<br />
Or in the noiseless moorland, sometimes sit,<br />
Immense, beneath the outspread wing of Night;<br />
Then waters on the wrinkled pond take fright;<br />
And the heather veils itself and palely glistens,<br />
And every leaf in every thicket listens,<br />
And the incendiary sunset stills<br />
The last cry of his light that o'er her thrills.<br />
<br />
And the hamlets neighbouring her, beneath<br />
Their thatch of hovels on the heath,<br />
Shiver with terror, feeling her<br />
Dominant, though she do not stir;<br />
Mournful, and tired, and helpless they<br />
Stand in her presence as at bay,<br />
And watch benumbed, and nigh to swoon,<br />
Fearing, when mists shall lift, to see,<br />
Suddenly opening under the moon,<br />
The silver eyes of her mystery.<br />

<br />
<br />
At the dike's foot that wearily<br />
Curves along the sinuous sea,<br />
The visionary, silver-haired<br />
Rope-maker with arms bared,<br />
Pulling backwards as he stands,<br />
Rolls together, with prudent hands,<br />
The twisting play of endless twine,<br />
Coming from the far sky-line.<br />
<br />
Down yonder in the sunset sheen,<br />
In the twilight tired and chill,<br />
A busy wheel is whizzing still,<br />
Moved by one who is not seen;<br />
But, parallel on stakes that space<br />
The road from equal place to place,<br />
The yellow hemp that the roper draws<br />
Runs in a chain that never flaws.<br />
<br />
With skilful fingers thin and old,<br />
Fearing to break the glint of gold<br />
That with his work the gliding light<br />
Blends by the houses growing dim,<br />
The visionary roper weaves<br />
Out of the heart of the eddying eves,<br />
And draws the horizons unto him.<br />
<br />
Horizons? Those of red sunsets:<br />
Furies, hatred, fights, regrets,<br />
Sobs of beings broken-hearted,<br />
Horizons of the days departed,<br />
Writhen, golden, overcast;<br />

Horizons of the living past.<br />
<br />
Of old&mdash;the life of strayed somnambulists,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the right hand of God to Canaans blue</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The road of gold through gloaming deserts drew,</span><br />
Through morns and evenings swayed with shifting mists.<br />
<br />
Of old&mdash;exasperated life careering<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hanging from stallions' manes, lighting the dense</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Darkness with heels that flashed out gleams immense,</span><br />
Towards immensity immensely rearing.<br />
<br />
Of old&mdash;it was a life of burning leaven;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the Red Cross of Hell and Heaven's White</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through miles of marshalled mail that shed the light</span><br />
Marched each through blood towards its victory's heaven.<br />
<br />
Of old&mdash;it was a foaming, livid life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Living and dead, with tocsin bells and crime,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Edicts and massacres reddening the time,</span><br />
With mad and splendid death above the strife.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Between the flax and osiers,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Image of the present time.</span><br />

Now, a mass of fires that belch defiance,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hurl the gods down to change the nothingness</span><br />
Whereunto strives the force of human science.<br />
<br />
Now, lo! a room that ruthless thought has swept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weighed and exactly measured, and men swear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The firmament is arched by empty air;</span><br />
And Death is in glass bottles corked and kept.<br />

Now, lo! a glowing furnace, and resistance<br />

<a name="SAINT_GEORGE" id="SAINT_GEORGE"></a>SAINT GEORGE.<br />
<br />
<br />
By a broad flash the fog was split,<br />
And Saint George, with gold and jewels lit,<br />
Came down the slope of it,<br />
With feathers foaming from his crest,<br />
Riding a charger with a milky breast,<br />
And in its mouth no bit.<br />
<br />
With diamonds decked the two<br />
Made of their fall a path of pity to<br />
This earth of ours from Heaven's blue.<br />
<br />
Heroes with helpful virtues dowered,<br />
Sonorous with courage, heroes crystalline,<br />
O through my heart now let the radiance shine<br />
That from his aureolar sword is showered!<br />
O let me hear the silver prattle<br />
Of the wind around his coat of mail,<br />
And around his spurs in battle;<br />
Saint George, who shall prevail,<br />
He who has heard the cries of my distress,<br />
And comes to save from scaith<br />
My poor arms stretched unto his great prowess!<br />
<br />
Like a loud cry of faith,<br />
He holds his lance at rest,<br />
Saint George;<br />
He passes, I behold<br />
A victory as of a haggard gold,<br />
I see his forehead with the Chrism blessed:<br />
Saint George of duty,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Bright with his heart's and his own beauty.<br />
<br />
Sound, all ye voices of my hope!<br />
Sound in myself, and on the sun-swept slope,<br />
And high roads, and the shaded avenue!<br />
And, gleams of silver between stones, be you<br />
Joy, and you pebbles white with waters ope<br />
Your eyes, and look<br />
Up through the brook<br />
Whose ripples o'er you roll,<br />
And, landscape with thy crimson lakes, be thou<br />
The mirror of the flights of flame that now<br />
Saint George takes to my soul!<br />
<br />
Against the black dragon's teeth,<br />
Against the pustules of a leprous skin<br />
He is the glaive and the miraculous sheath.<br />
Charity on his cuirass burns, and in<br />
His courage is the bounding overthrow<br />
Of instinct swart with sin.<br />
<br />
Fire golden-sifted, fire that wheels,<br />
And eddying stars in which his glory lies,<br />
Flashed from his charger's galloping heels,<br />
Dazzle my memory's eyes.<br />
<br />
The beautiful ambassador is he<br />
From the white country that with marble glows,<br />
Where in the parks, on the sea's strand, and on the tree<br />
Of goodness, kindness gently grows.<br />
<br />
The port, he knows it, where the vessels ride,<br />
With angels filled, upon a rippling tide;<br />
And the long evenings lighting islands fair<br />
But motionless upon their waters, where,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
And in eyes also, firmaments are seen.<br />
<br />
This kingdom hath the Virgin for its Queen,<br />
And St. George is the humble joy of her palace,<br />
In the air his falchion glimmers like a chalice;<br />
Saint George with his devouring light,<br />
Who like a fire of gold dispels my spirit's night.<br />
<br />
He knows how far my feet have wandered,<br />
He knows the strength that I have squandered,<br />
And with what fogs my brain has fought,<br />
He knows what keen assassin knives<br />
Have cut black crosses in my thought,<br />
He knows my scorn of rich men's lives,<br />
He knows the mask of wrath and folly<br />
Upon the dregs of my melancholy.<br />
<br />
I was a coward in my flight<br />
Out of the world in my sick, vain defiance;<br />
I have lifted, under the roofs of night,<br />
The golden marbles of a hostile science<br />
To the barred summits of black oracles;<br />
But the King of the Night is Death;<br />
And man but in the dawning's breath<br />
His enigmatic effort spells;<br />
When flowers unclose, prayer too uncloses,<br />
With the scent of prayer their lips are sweet,<br />
And the white sun on a nacreous water-sheet<br />
Is a kiss that on man's lips reposes;<br />
Dawn is a counsel to be bold,<br />
And he who hearkens is tenfold<br />
Saved from the marsh that never yet cleansed sin.<br />
<br />
Saint George in cuirass glittering<br />
With leaps of fire sprung<br />
Unto my soul through the fresh morning;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
He was beautiful with faith and young;<br />
<br />
And more to me he bent<br />
As he beheld me penitent;<br />
As from an intimate golden phial<br />
He filled me with his soaring;<br />
Though he was proud unto my sight,<br />
I laid the sweet flowers of my trial<br />
In his pale hand of blest restoring;<br />
Then signed he, ere he did depart,<br />
My brow with his lance's cross of gold,<br />
Bade me be of good cheer and bold,<br />
And soared, and bore to God my heart.<br />

<br />
Two ancient mariners from the Northern Main<br />
One autumn eve came sailing home again,<br />
From Sicily and its deceitful islands,<br />
Carrying a shoal of sirens<br />
On board.<br />
<br />
Sharpened with pride they sail into their bay;<br />
Among the mists that mark the homeward way<br />
They cut their passage like a sword;<br />
Under a mournful and monotonous gale,<br />
One autumn evening of a sadness pale,<br />
Into their northern fjord they sail.<br />
<br />
From the safe shore the burghers of the haven<br />
Gaze listless, cold, and craven:<br />
And on the masts, and in the ropes, behold<br />
The sirens covered with gold<br />
Biting, like vines,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Their bodies' sinuous lines.<br />
<br />
The burghers gaze with closed and sullen mouth,<br />
Nor see the ocean booty of the south,<br />
Brought in the fog's despite;<br />
The vessel seems a basket silver-white,<br />
Laden with flesh and fruit and gold for home,<br />
Advancing borne on wings of foam.<br />
<br />
The sirens sing, and in the cordage they<br />
With arms stretched out in lyres,<br />
And lifted breasts like fires,<br />
Sing and sing a lay<br />
Before the rolling eve,<br />
Which reaps upon the sea the lights of day;<br />
The sirens sing, and cleave<br />
Around the masts as curves the handle of the urn<br />
And still the citizens, uncouth and taciturn,<br />
Hear not the song.<br />
<br />
They do not know their friends away so long&mdash;<br />
The ancient mariners twain&mdash;nor understand<br />
The vessel is of their own land,<br />
Neither the foc-jibs of their own<br />
Making, nor the sails themselves have sewn;<br />
Of this deep dream they fathom naught,<br />
Which makes the sea glad with its journeyings,<br />
Since it was not the lie of all the things<br />
That in their village to their youth were taught.<br />
And the ship passes by the harbour mole,<br />
Luring them to the wonder of its soul,<br />
But none will gather them the fruits<br />
Of flesh and gold that load the trellised shoots.<br />

<a name="THE_TOWN" id="THE_TOWN"></a>THE TOWN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every road goes to the town.<br />
<br />
Under the mist that the sun illumes,<br />
She, where her terraces arise<br />
And taper to the terraced skies,<br />
Herself as from a dream exhumes.<br />
<br />
Yonder glimmer looking down,<br />
Bridges trimmed with iron lace,<br />
Leaps in air and caught in space;<br />
Blocks and columns like the head<br />
Of a Gorgon gashed and red;<br />
O'er the suburbs chimneys tower;<br />
Gables open like a flower,<br />
Under stagnant roofs that frown.<br />
<br />
This is the many-tentacled town,<br />
This is the flaming octopus,<br />
The ossuary of all of us.<br />
At the country's end she waits,<br />
Feeling towards the old estates.<br />
<br />
Meteoric gas-lamps line<br />
Docks where tufted masts entwine;<br />
Still they burn in noontides cold,<br />
Monster eggs of viscous gold;<br />
Never seems the sun to shine:<br />
Mouth as it is of radiance, shut<br />
By reeking smoke and driving smut.<br />
<br />
A river of pitch and naphtha rolls<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
By wooden bridges, mortared moles;<br />
And the raw whistles of the ships<br />
Howl with fright in the fog that grips:<br />
With a red signal light they peer<br />
Towards the sea to which they steer.<br />
<br />
Quays with clashing buffers groan;<br />
Carts grate o'er the cobble-stone;<br />
Cranes are cubes of shadow raising,<br />
And slipping them in cellars blazing;<br />
Bridges opening lift a vast<br />
Gibbet till the ships have passed;<br />
Letters of brass inscribe the world,<br />
On roofs, and walls, and shop-fronts curled,<br />
Face to face in battle massed.<br />
<br />
Wheels file and file, the drosky plies,<br />
Trains are rolling, effort flies;<br />
And like a prow becalmed, the glare<br />
Of gilded stations here and there;<br />
And, from their platforms, ramified<br />
Rails beneath the city glide,<br />
In tunnels and in craters, whence<br />
They storm in network flashing thin<br />
Out into hubbub, dust, and din.<br />
<br />
This is the many-tentacled town.<br />
<br />
The street, with eddies tied like ropes<br />
Around its squares, runs out and gropes<br />
Along the city up and down,<br />
And runs back far enlaced, and lined<br />
With crowds inextricably twined,<br />
Whose mad feet beat the flags beneath,<br />
Whose eyes are filled with hate, whose teeth<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Snatch at the time they cannot catch.<br />
<br />
Dawn, eve, and night, lost in the press,<br />
They welter in their weariness,<br />
And cast to chance the bitter seed<br />
Of labour that no gain can breed.<br />
And dens black with inanity<br />
Where poisoned sits the clerk and fasts;<br />
And banks wide open to the blasts<br />
Of the winds of their insanity.<br />
<br />
Outside, in wadding of the damp,<br />
Red lights in streaks, like burning rags,<br />
Straggle from reeking lamp to lamp.<br />
And alcohol goads life that lags.<br />
The bar upon the causey masses<br />
Its tabernacle of looking-glasses,<br />
Reflecting drunken louts and hags.<br />
To and fro a young girl passes,<br />
And sells lights to the lolling men;<br />
Debauch buys famine in her den;<br />
And carnal lust ignited sallies<br />
To dance to death in rotten alleys.<br />
<br />
Lust roars and leaps from breast to breast,<br />
Whipped to a rage uproarious,<br />
To a blind crush of limbs in quest<br />
Of the pleasure of gold and phosphorus;<br />
And in and out wan women fare,<br />
With sexual symbols in their hair.<br />
The atmosphere of reeking dun<br />
At times recedes towards the sun,<br />
As though a loud cry called to Peace<br />
To bid the deafening noises cease;<br />
But all the city puffs and blows<br />
With such a violent snort and flush,<br />
That the dying seek in vain the hush<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Of silence that eyes need to close.<br />
<br />
Such is the day&mdash;and when the eves<br />
With ebony hammers carve the skies,<br />
Over the plain the city heaves<br />
Its shimmer of colossal lies;<br />
Her haunting, gilt desires arise;<br />
Her radiance to the stars is cast;<br />
She gathers her gas in golden sheaves;<br />
Her rails are highways flying fast<br />
To the mirage of happiness<br />
That strength and fortune seem to bless;<br />
Like a great army swell her walls;<br />
And all the smoke she still sends down<br />
Reaches the fields in radiant calls.<br />
<br />
This is the many-tentacled town,<br />
This is the burning octopus,<br />
The ossuary of all of us,<br />
The carcase with solemn candles lit.<br />
<br />
And all the long ubiquitous<br />
Roads and pathways reach to it.<br />
<br />
<br />

<a name="THE_MUSIC-HALL" id="THE_MUSIC-HALL"></a>THE MUSIC-HALL.<br />
<br />
<br />
Under the enormous fog<br />
Whose wings the city arteries clog,<br />
'Mid ringing plaudits, at the back<br />
Of a radiant hall their Orients they unpack.<br />
<br />
The acrobat on airy trestles poises;<br />
Great suns of strass shine o'er the scene;<br />
Clashing their fists stand cymbal-players, lean<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Breakers of cries and noises;<br />
<br />
And when the ballet-corps with painted faces<br />
In a thicket of perplexing steps appear,<br />
Tangling and disentangling labyrinthine paces,<br />
The hall, hung with its gorgeous chandelier,<br />
That o'er a surging sea of faces glares,<br />
The hall with heavy velvet clad,<br />
With balconies like pad on pad,<br />
Is like a belly that a woman bares.<br />
<br />
Swarming battalions of flesh and thighs<br />
March under arches flowered with thousand dyes;<br />
Lace, petticoats, throats, legs, and hips:<br />
Teams of rut whose breasts, though bridled, yet<br />
Are bounding, yoke by yoke the coiled dance trips,<br />
Blue with paint and raw with sweat.<br />
<br />
Hands, vainly opening, seem to seize<br />
Only invisible desire that flees;<br />
A dancer, darting legs her tights leave bare,<br />
Stiffens obscenity in the air;<br />
Another with swimming eyes and flanks that writhe<br />
Shrinks like a trampled beast above the loud<br />
Flare of the footlights swaying with the lithe<br />
Lust of the gloating crowd.<br />
<br />
O blasphemy vociferously hurled<br />
In crying gold on the Beauty of the world!<br />
Atrocious feint of Art, while Art sublime<br />
Is lying massacred and sunk in slime!<br />
O noisy pleasure singing as it treads<br />
On tortured ugliness that twists and cries;<br />
Pleasure against Joy's grain that nurtures heads<br />
With alcohol, with alcohol men's eyes;<br />
O pleasure whose rank mouth calls out for flowers,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
And vomits the vile ferment it devours!<br />
<br />
Pleasure of old, heroic, calm, and bare,<br />
Walked with calm hands and forehead clear as air;<br />
The wind and the sun danced in his heart, he pressed<br />
Divine, harmonious life, to his warm breast;<br />
His breast that breathed it in was Beauty's source;<br />
He knew no law that dared call Beauty coarse;<br />
Sunrise and sunset, springs with mosses grassed,<br />
And the green bough that brushed him as he passed,<br />
Thrilled to his deep soul through his flesh, and were<br />
The kiss of things that love makes lovelier.<br />
<br />
Now senile and debauched, he licks and eats<br />
Sin that beguiles him with her poisoned teats;<br />
Now in his garden of anomalies<br />
Bibles, codes, texts, and rules he multiplies,<br />
And ravishes the faith he then denies.<br />
His loves are gold. His hatreds? Flights unto<br />
Beauty that grows still lovelier, still more true,<br />
Opening in starry flowers in heavens blue.<br />
Look where he haunts these halls of monstrous art,<br />
Whose burning windows to the heavens dart<br />
A restlessness by gazing still renewed:<br />
Here is the beast transformed to a multitude.<br />
<br />
Filled with contagion thousand eyes deflect<br />
To find a million more they may infect;<br />
One mind to thousands casts its brazier fire,<br />
To be consumed the more in sick desire,<br />
To breed new vices, unimagined Hell.<br />
The conscience changes, and the brain as well;<br />
Another race is bred from putrid spawn,<br />
A writhen black totality, a sum<br />
Of ciphers spreading in a weltering scum,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
That outrages the healthfulness of Dawn.<br />
<br />
O shames and crimes of crowds that reek and stain<br />
The city like a bellowing hurricane;<br />
Gulfed in the plaster boxes tier on tier<br />
Of theatres and halls obscene and blear!<br />
<br />
The stage is like a fan unfurled.<br />
Enamelled minarets grotesquely curled.<br />
Houses and terraces and avenues.<br />
Under the limelight's changing hues,<br />
First in slow rhythms, then with violent sweep,<br />
Gathering swift kisses, touching breasts that leap,<br />
Meet the Bayadères with swaying hips;<br />
Negro boys, whose heads with plumes are tipped,<br />
With their foam-coloured teeth in lips<br />
Like a red vulva open ripped,<br />
Move all as pushed along in sluggish poses.<br />
A drum beats, an obstinate horn cries long,<br />
A raw fife tickles a stupid song,<br />
And at the last, for the final apotheosis,<br />
A mad assault over the boards is sweeping,<br />
Gold and throats and thighs in stages heaping<br />
In curled entanglements; and then all closes<br />
With garments splitting offering rounded shapes<br />
And vice half hid in flowers like tempting grapes.<br />
<br />
And the orchestra dies, or suddenly halts,<br />
And climbs, and swells, and rolls in whipped assaults;<br />
Out of the violins wriggle spasms dark;<br />
Lascivious dogs in the tempest seem to bark<br />
Of heavy brasses and of strong bassoons;<br />
A manifold desire swells, sickens, swoons,<br />
Revives, and with such heavy violence heaves,<br />
The sense cries out, and helpless reels,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
And prostitutes itself to a spasm that relieves.<br />
<br />
And midnight peals.<br />
The dense crowd pours and at the doors unfurls.<br />
The hall is closed&mdash;and on the black causeways,<br />
Gaudy beneath the gaslamps' leering gaze,<br />
Red in the fog like flesh, await the girls.<br />

<a name="THE_BUTCHERS_STALL" id="THE_BUTCHERS_STALL"></a>THE BUTCHER'S STALL.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hard by the docks, soon as the shadows fold<br />
The dizzy mansion-fronts that soar aloft,<br />
When eyes of lamps are burning soft,<br />
The shy, dark quarter lights again its old<br />
Allurement of red vice and gold.<br />
<br />
Women, blocks of heaped, blown meat,<br />
Stand on low thresholds down the narrow street,<br />
Calling to every man that passes;<br />
Behind them, at the end of corridors,<br />
Shine fires, a curtain stirs<br />
And gives a glimpse of masses<br />
Of mad and naked flesh in looking-glasses.<br />
Hard by the docks.<br />
The street upon the left is ended by<br />
A tangle of high masts and shrouds that blocks<br />
A sheet of sky;<br />
Upon the right a net of grovelling alleys<br />
Falls from the town&mdash;and here the black crowd rallies<br />
To reel to rotten revelry.<br />
<br />
It is the flabby, fulsome butcher's stall of luxury,<br />
Time out of mind erected on the frontiers<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Of the city and the sea.<br />
<br />
Far-sailing melancholy mariners<br />
Who, wet with spray, through grey mists peer,<br />
Cradled among the rigging cabin-boys, and they who steer<br />
Hallucinated by the blue eyes of the vast sea-spaces,<br />
All dream of it, evoke it when the evening falls;<br />
Their raw desire to madness galls;<br />
The wind's soft kisses hover on their faces;<br />
The wave awakens rolling images of soft embraces;<br />
And their two arms implore,<br />
Stretched in a frantic cry towards the shore.<br />
<br />
And they of offices and shops, the city tribes,<br />
Merchants precise, keen reckoners, haggard scribes,<br />
Who sell their brains for hire, and tame their brows,<br />
When the keys of desks are hanging on the wall,<br />
Feel the same galling rut at even-fall,<br />
And run like hunted dogs to the carouse.<br />
Out of the depths of dusk come their dark flocks,<br />
And in their hearts debauch so rudely shocks<br />
Their ingrained greed and old accustomed care,<br />
That they are racked and ruined by despair.<br />
<br />
It is the flabby, fulsome butcher's stall of luxury,<br />
Time out of mind erected on the frontiers<br />
Of the city and the sea.<br />
<br />
Come from what far sea-isles or pestilent parts?<br />
Come from what feverish or methodic marts?<br />
Their eyes are filled with bitter, cunning hate,<br />
They fight their instincts that they cannot sate;<br />
Around red females who befool them, they<br />
Herd frenzied till the dawn of sober day.<br />
The panelling is fiery with lewd art;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Out of the wall nitescent knick-knacks dart;<br />
Fat Bacchuses and leaping satyrs in<br />
Wan mirrors freeze an unremitting grin;<br />
Flowers sicken on the gaming-tables where<br />
The warming bowls twist fire of light blue hair;<br />
A pot of paint curds on an étagère;<br />
A cat is catching flies on cushioned seats;<br />
A drunkard lolls asleep on yielding plush,<br />
And women come, and o'er him bending, brush<br />
His closed, red lids with their enormous teats.<br />
<br />
And women with spent loins and sleeping croups<br />
Are piled on sofas and arm-chairs in groups,<br />
With sodden flesh grown vague, and black and blue<br />
With the first trampling of the evening's crew.<br />
One of them slides a gold coin in her stocking;<br />
Another yawns, and some their knees are rocking;<br />
Others by bacchanalia worn out,<br />
Feeling old age, and, sniffing them, Death's snout,<br />
Stare with wide-open eyes, torches extinct,<br />
And smooth their legs with hands together linked.<br />
<br />
It is the flabby, fulsome butcher's stall of luxury,<br />
Time out of mind erected on the frontiers<br />
Of the city and the sea.<br />
<br />
According to the jingle of the purses<br />
The women mingle promises with curses;<br />
A tranquil cynicism, a tired pleasure<br />
Is meted duly to the money's measure.<br />
<br />
The kiss grows weary, and the game grows tame.<br />
Often when fist with fist together clashes,<br />
In the wind of oaths and insults still the same,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Some gaiety out of the blasphemy flashes,<br />
<br />
But soon sinks, and you hear,<br />
In the silence dank and drear,<br />
A halting steeple near<br />
Sounding, sick with pity,<br />
In the darkness over the city.<br />
<br />
Yet in those months by festivals sanctified,<br />
St. Peter in summer, in winter Christmastide,<br />
The ancient quarter of dirt and light<br />
Soars up to sin and pounces on its joys,<br />
Fermenting with wild songs and boisterous noise<br />
Window by window, flight by flight,<br />
With vice the house-fronts glow<br />
Down from the garret to the grids below.<br />
Everywhere rage roars, and couples heats.<br />
In the great hall to which the sailors throng,<br />
Pushing some jester of the streets,<br />
Convulsed in obscene mimicry, along,<br />
The wines of foam and gold leap from their sheath;<br />
Women fall underneath<br />
Mad, brawling drunkards; loosened ruts<br />
Flame, arms unite, and body body butts;<br />
Nothing is seen but instincts slaked and lit afresh,<br />
Breasts offered, bellies taken, and the fire<br />
Of haggard eyes in sheaves of brandished flesh.<br />
<br />
The frenzy climbs, and sinks to rise still higher,<br />
Rolls like exasperated tides,<br />
And backwards glides,<br />
Until the moment when dawn fills the port,<br />
And Death, tired of the sport,<br />
Back to ships and homesteads sweeps and harries<br />
The limp debauch and human weed<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
That on the pavement tarries.<br />
<br />
It is the flabby, fulsome butcher's stall of luxury,<br />
Wherein Crime plants his knives that bleed,<br />
Where lightning madness stains<br />
Foreheads with rotting pains,<br />
Time out of mind erected on the frontiers that feed<br />
The city and the sea.<br />

When the wind sulks, and the dune dries,<br />
The old salts with uneasy eyes<br />
Hour after hour peer at the skies.<br />
<br />
All are silent; their hands turning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A brown juice from their lips they wipe;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never a sound save, in their pipe,</span><br />
The dry tobacco burning.<br />
<br />
That storm the almanac announces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where is it? They are puzzled.</span><br />
The sea has smoothed her flounces.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Winter is muzzled.</span><br />
<br />
The cute ones shake their pate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cross their arms, and puff.</span><br />
But mate by mate they wait,<br />
And think the squall is late,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But coming sure enough.</span><br />
<br />
With fingers slow, sedate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their finished pipe they fill;</span><br />
Pursuing, every salt,<br />
Without a minute's halt,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>

A boat sails up the bay,<br />
As tranquil as the day;<br />
Its keel a long net trails,<br />
Covered with glittering scales.<br />
<br />
Out come the men: What ho?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When will the tempest come?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With pipe in mouth, still dumb,</span><br />
With bare foot on <i>sabot,</i><br />
The salts wait in a row.<br />
<br />
Here they lounge about,<br />
Where all year long the stout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fishers' dames</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sell, from their wooden frames,</span><br />
Herrings and anchovies,<br />
And by each stall a stove is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To warm them with its flames.</span><br />
<br />
Here they spit together,<br />
Spying out the weather.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here they yawn and doze;</span><br />
Backs bent with many a squall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rubbing it in rows,</span><br />
Grease the wall.<br />
<br />
And though the almanac<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is wrong about the squall,</span><br />
The old salts lean their back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against the wall,</span><br />
And wait in rows together,<br />
Watching the sea and the weather.<br />

I had in me so much tenacious rust,<br />

I was so tired, I was so spent,<br />
I was so old with my mistrust,<br />
I was so tired, I was so spent<br />
With all the roads of my discontent.<br />

Save through the casement panes the climbing roses,<br />
<br />
So sweet the days are, after olden trial,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So sweet with silence is the summer time,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I often stay the hour upon the chime</span><br />
In the clock of oak-wood with the golden dial.<br />
<br />
And then the day, the night is so much ours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the hush of happiness around us starts</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hear the beating of our clinging hearts,</span><br />
When on your face my kisses fall in showers.<br />

<br />
This is the good hour when the lamp is lit.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All is calm, and consoling, and dear,</span><br />
And the silence is such that you could hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A feather falling in it.</span><br />
<br />
This is the good hour when to my chair my love will flit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As breezes blow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As smoke will rise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gentle, slow.</span><br />
She says nothing at first&mdash;and I am listening;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I hear all her soul, I surprise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Its gushing and glistening,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I kiss her eyes.</span><br />
<br />
This is the good hour when the lamp is lit.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When hearts will say</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How they have loved each other through the day.</span><br />
<br />
And one says such simple things:<br />
The fruit one from the garden brings;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The flower that one has seen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Opening in mosses green;</span><br />
<br />
And the heart will of a sudden thrill and glow,<br />
Remembering some faded word of love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Found in a drawer beneath a cast-off glove</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a letter of a year ago.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
Yet, after years and years, to Eve there came<br />
Impatience in her soul, and as a blight<br />
Of being the sapless, loveless flower of white<br />
And torrid happiness that cleaved the same;<br />
And once, when in the skies the tempest moved<br />
Fain had she risen and its lightning proved.<br />
Then did a sweet, broad shudder glide on her;<br />
And, in her deepest flesh to feel it, Eve<br />
Pressed her frail hands against her bosom's heave.<br />
The angel, when he felt the sleeper stir<br />
With violent abrupt awakening,<br />
And scattered air and arms, and body rocked,<br />
Questioned the night, but Eve remained unlocked,<br />
And silent. He in vain bespoke each thing<br />
That lived beside her by the naked sources,<br />
Birds, flowers, and mirrors of cold water-courses<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
With which, perchance, her unknown thought arose<br />
Up from the ground; and one night when he bowed,<br />
And with his reverent fingers sought to close<br />
Her eyes, she leapt out of his great wing's shroud.<br />
O fertile folly in its sudden flare<br />
Beyond the too pure angel's baffled care!<br />
For while he stretched his arms out she was drifting<br />
Already far, and passionately lifting<br />
To braziers of the stars her body bare.<br />
<br />
And all the heart of Adam, seeing her so,<br />
Trembled.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">She willed to love, he willed to know.</span><br />
<br />
Awkward and shy he neared her, daring not<br />
To startle eyes that lost in reveries swam;<br />
From terebinths were fluttered scents, and from<br />
The soil's fermenting mounted odours hot.<br />
<br />
He tarried, as if waiting for her hests;<br />
But she snatched up his hands, and o'er them hung,<br />
And kissed them slowly, long, with kiss that clung,<br />
And guided them to cool erected breasts.<br />
<br />
But through her flesh they burned and burned. His mouth<br />
Had found the fires to set on flame his drouth,<br />
And his lithe fingers spread her streaming tresses<br />
O'er the long ardour of their first caresses.<br />
<br />
Stretched by the cool of fountains both were lying,<br />
Seen of their passion-gleaming eyes alone.<br />
And Adam felt a sudden thought unknown<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Well in his heart to her fast heart replying.<br />
<br />
Eve's body hid profound retreats as sweet<br />
As moss that by the noon's cool breeze is brushed;<br />
Gladly came sheaves undone to be their seat,<br />
Gladly the grass was by their loving crushed.<br />
<br />
And when the spasm leapt from them at last,<br />
And held them bruised in arms strained stiff and tight,<br />
All the great amorous and feline night<br />
Tempered its breeze as over them it passed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">But on their vision burst</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">A cloud far off at first,</span><br />
And whirling its dizziness with such a blast<br />
That it was all a miracle and a fright,<br />
Leapt from the dim horizon through the night.<br />
Adam raised Eve, and pressed unto him fast<br />
Her shivering body exquisitely wan.<br />
Livid and sulphurous the cloud came on,<br />
With thundering threats o'erflowing, and red lit.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Suddenly on the spot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Where the wild grass was hot</span><br />
With their two bodies that had loved on it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">All the loud</span><br />
Rage of the dark, tremendous cloud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Bit.</span><br />
<br />
And the voice of the Lord God in its shadow sounded,<br />
Fires from the flowers and nightly bushes bounded;<br />
And where the dark the turning paths submerged,<br />
With sword in hand flamboyant angels surged;<br />
Lions were roaring at the fateful skies,<br />
Eagles hailed death with hoarsely boding cries;<br />
And by the waters all the palm-trees bent<br />
Under the same hard wind of discontent<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
That beat on Eve and Adam on that sward,<br />
And in the vasty darkness drove them toward<br />
New human worlds more fervent than the old.<br />

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />

Now felt the man a magnet manifold<br />
Draw out his strength and mingle it with all;<br />
Ends he divined, and knew what gave them birth;<br />
His lover's lips with words grew magical;<br />
And his unwritten simple heart loved earth,<br />
And serviceable water, trees that hold<br />
Authority, and stones that broken shine.<br />
Fruits tempted him to take their placid gold,<br />
And the bruised grapes of the translucent vine<br />
Kindled his thirst which they were ripe to still.<br />
The howling beasts he chased awoke the skill<br />
That in his hands had slept; and pride dowered him<br />
With vehement strengths that foam and over-brim,<br />
That he himself his destiny might build.<br />
<br />
And the woman, still more fair since by the man<br />
The marvellous shiver through her body ran,<br />
Lived in the woods of gold by perfumes filled<br />
And dawn, with all the future in her tears.<br />
In her awoke the first soul, made of pride<br />
And sweet strength blended with an unknown shame,<br />
At the hour when all her heart was shed in flame<br />
On the child sheltered in her naked side.<br />
And when the day burns glorious and is done,<br />
And feet of tall trees in the forests gleam,<br />
She laid her body full of her young dream<br />
On sloping rocks gilt by the setting sun;<br />
Her lifted breasts two rounded shadows showed<br />
Upon her skin as rosy as a shell,<br />
And the sun that on her pregnant body glowed<br />
Seemed to be ripening all the world as well.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Valiant and grave she pondered, burning, slow,<br />
<br />
How by her love the lot of men should grow,<br />
And of the beautiful and violent will<br />
Fated to tame the earth. Ye sacred cares<br />
And griefs, she saw you, you she saw, despairs!<br />
And all the darkest deeps of human ill.<br />
And with transfigured face and statelier bearing<br />
She took your hands in hers and kissed your brow;<br />
But you as well, men's grandeur madly daring,<br />
You lifted up her soul, and she saw how<br />
The limitless sands of time should by your tide<br />
Be buried under billows singing pride;<br />
In you she hoped, ideas keen in quest,<br />
Fervour to love and to desire the best<br />
In valiant pain and anguished joy; and so,<br />
One evening roving in the after-glow,<br />
When she beheld, come to a mossy plot,<br />
The gates of Paradise thrown open wide,<br />
And the angel beckoning, she turned aside<br />
Without desire of it, and entered not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span><br />

name of "Monsieur Fromage."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_13">13</a>, <i>seq</i>.&mdash;Max Elskamp's poetry is considered somewhat obscure,
and students may find the following equations of help: la Vierge = la
femme pure; Jésus = l'enfance délicieuse; un dimanche solaire = une joie
éclatante; un dimanche de cur de bois = une joie égoïste; un soldat

poet is the Sunday, therefore, since the week is about to begin again,
he <i>must</i> die. The third stanza means that the Truelove will never again
weep for the fair days of betrothal or marriage which the old family
ring she wears remind her of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

constantly changing, "en devenir dans le devenir." And yet there is in
it a continued, though mobile unity, a permanent <i>rhythm</i>. It
objectifies itself in space, but only exists in time, and Mockel sees
its vital sign in those <i>aspirations</i> which guide it towards itself,
which bear it on to its fate. The unity of the mobile river, whose waves
to-morrow will no longer be those they are to-day, is the continuous
current that bears it, as though it aspired to the infinity of oceans.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
